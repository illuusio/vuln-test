The\n>     vulnerability is due to allowing the ClamD process to\n>     write to its log file while privileged without checking\n>     if the logfile has been replaced with a symbolic\n>     link. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if\n>     they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a\n>     critical system file and then find a way to restart the\n>     ClamD process.

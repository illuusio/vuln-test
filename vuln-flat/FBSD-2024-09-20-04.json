The introduced check was\nincorrect, as it took into account the size of the pointer, not the\nstructure. This vulnerability affects both kernel and userland.\n\nThis issue was originally intended to be addressed as part of\nFreeBSD-SA-24:09.libnv, but due to a logic issue, this issue was\nnot properly addressed.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIt is possible for an attacker to overwrite portions of memory\n(in userland or the kernel) as the allocated buffer might be smaller\nthan the data received from a malicious process. This vulnerability\ncould result in privilege escalation or cause a system panic.",

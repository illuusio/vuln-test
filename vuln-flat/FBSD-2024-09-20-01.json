This allows readdir(3) and related functions to return\nfilesystem entries with names containing additional path components.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nThe lack of validation described above gives rise to a confused\ndeputy problem. For example, a program copying files from an NFS\nmount could be tricked into copying from outside the intended source\ndirectory, and/or to a location outside the intended destination\ndirectory.",

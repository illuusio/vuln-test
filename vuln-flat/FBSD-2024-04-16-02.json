Here,\n> the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to\n> determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private\n> key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other\n> services. If the other services include Git services, then again it\n> may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software\n> maintained in Git.

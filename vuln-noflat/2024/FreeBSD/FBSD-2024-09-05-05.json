An insufficient\nboundary validation in the USB code could lead to an out-of-bounds\nwrite on the heap, with data controlled by the caller.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nA malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can\nexploit the vulnerability to achieve code execution on the host in\nthe bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root. Note\nthat bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained\nby the capabilities available to the bhyve process.",

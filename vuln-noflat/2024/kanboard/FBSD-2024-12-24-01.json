    "details": "security-advisories@github.com reports:\n\n> Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban\n> methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even\n> though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom\n> session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`), to store\n> the session data in a database. Therefore, when a `session\\_id` is\n> given, kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At\n> this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given `session\\_id`\n> has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires\\_at`). Thus, a session\n> which's lifetime is already `> time()`, is still queried\n> from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented\n> \\*\\*SessionHandlerInterface::gc\\*\\* function, that does remove invalid\n> sessions, is called only \\*\\*with a certain probability\\*\\* (\\_Cleans\n> up expired sessions. Called by `session\\_start()`, based on\n> `session.gc\\_divisor`, `session.gc\\_probability` and `session.gc\\_maxlifetime`\n> settings\\_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official\n> Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc\\_probability=1,\n> session.gc\\_divisor=1000. Thus, an expired session is only terminated\n> with probability 1/1000. There are no known workarounds for\n> this vulnerability.",

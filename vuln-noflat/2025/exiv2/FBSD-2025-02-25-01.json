Exiv2 is a\n> command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and\n> modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when\n> Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker\n> could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if\n> they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\n>\n> Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which\n> is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For\n> example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you\n> need to add an extra command-line argument such as fixiso.",

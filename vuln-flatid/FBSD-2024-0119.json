Web content that tried to\n>   use those interfaces would not be able to use them with\n>   elevated privileges, but their presence would indicate\n>   certain browser features had been used, such as when a user\n>   opened the Dev Tools console.\n> * CVE-2024-8383: Firefox normally asks for confirmation\n>   before asking the operating system to find an application to\n>   handle a scheme that the browser does not support. It did not\n>   ask before doing so for the Usenet-related schemes news: and\n>   snews:. Since most operating systems don't have a\n>   trusted newsreader installed by default, an unscrupulous\n>   program that the user downloaded could register itself as a\n>   handler. The website that served the application download\n>   could then launch that application at will.\n> * CVE-2024-8384: The JavaScript garbage collector could\n>   mis-color cross-compartment objects if OOM conditions were\n>   detected at the right point between two passes. This could have\n>   led to memory corruption.\n> * CVE-2024-8385: A difference in the handling of\n>   StructFields and ArrayTypes in WASM could be used to trigger\n>   an exploitable type confusion vulnerability.\n> * CVE-2024-8386: If a site had been granted the permission\n>   to open popup windows, it could cause Select elements to\n>   appear on top of another site to perform a spoofing attack.\n> * CVE-2024-8387: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 129,\n>   Firefox ESR 128.1, and Thunderbird 128.1. Some of these bugs\n>   showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with\n>   enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run\n>   arbitrary code.\n> * CVE-2024-8389: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 129.\n>   Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we\n>   presume that with enough effort some of these could have been\n>   exploited to run arbitrary code.",

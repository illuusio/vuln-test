    "details": "Suricate team reports:\n\n> Multiple vulnerabilities\n\n* CVE-2025-29915: Severity HIGH. The AF\\_PACKET defrag option\n  is enabled by default and allows AF\\_PACKET to re-assemble\n  fragmented packets before reaching Suricata. However the\n  default packet size in Suricata is based on the network\n  interface MTU which leads to Suricata seeing truncated\n  packets.\n* CVE-2025-29916: Severity Moderate. Datasets declared in\n  rules have an option to specify the `hashsize` to use.\n  This size setting isn't properly limited, so the hash\n  table allocation can be large. Untrusted rules can lead to\n  large memory allocations, potentially leading to denial of\n  service due to resource starvation\n* CVE-2025-29917: Severity HIGH. The bytes setting in the\n  decode\\_base64 keyword is not properly limited. Due to\n  this, signatures using the keyword and setting can cause\n  large memory allocations of up to 4 GiB per thread.\n* CVE-2025-29918: Severity HIGH. A PCRE rule can be written\n  that leads to an infinite loop when negated PCRE is used.\n  Packet processing thread becomes stuck in infinite loop\n  limiting visibility and availability in inline mode.",

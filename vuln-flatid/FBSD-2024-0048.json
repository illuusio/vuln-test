    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in the bhyve hypervisor's\ndevice models.\n\nThe NVMe driver function nvme\\_opc\\_get\\_log\\_page is vulnerable to a\nbuffer over- read from a guest-controlled value. (CVE-2024-51562)\n\nThe virtio\\_vq\\_recordon function is subject to a time-of-check to\ntime-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. (CVE-2024-51563)\n\nA guest can trigger an infinite loop in the hda audio driver.\n(CVE-2024-51564)\n\nThe hda driver is vulnerable to a buffer over-read from a\nguest-controlled value. (CVE-2024-51565)\n\nThe NVMe driver queue processing is vulernable to guest-induced\ninfinite loops. (CVE-2024-51566)\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nMalicious guest virtual machines may be able to perform a denial\nof service (DoS) of the bhyve host, and may read memory within the\nbhyve process that they should not be able to access.",

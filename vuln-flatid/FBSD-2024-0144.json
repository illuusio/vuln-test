In\n>   Firefox this only affects the QUIC header protection\n>   feature when the connection is using the ChaCha20-Poly1305\n>   cipher suite. The most likely outcome is connection\n>   failure, but if the connection persists despite the high\n>   packet loss it could be possible for a network observer to\n>   identify packets as coming from the same source despite a\n>   network path change. This vulnerability affects Firefox\n>   < 129, Firefox ESR < 115.14, and Firefox ESR <\n>   128.1.\n> * CVE-2024-7529: The date picker could partially obscure\n>   security prompts.

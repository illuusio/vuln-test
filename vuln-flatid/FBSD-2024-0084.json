This can lead to degraded performance and\n> eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks.\n>\n> Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of\n> name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.\n> Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed\n> packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to\n> avoid locking the CPU for long.\n>\n> This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.",

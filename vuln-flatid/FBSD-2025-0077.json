If\n>   a client manages to free the root cursor, the internal reference points\n>   to freed memory and causes a use-after-free.\n> * CVE-2025-26595: Buffer overflow in XkbVModMaskText()\n>\n>   The code in XkbVModMaskText() allocates a fixed sized buffer on the\n>   stack and copies the names of the virtual modifiers to that buffer.\n>   The code however fails to check the bounds of the buffer correctly and\n>   would copy the data regardless of the size, which may lead to a buffer\n>   overflow.\n> * CVE-2025-26596: Heap overflow in XkbWriteKeySyms()\n>\n>   The computation of the length in XkbSizeKeySyms() differs from what is\n>   actually written in XkbWriteKeySyms(), which may lead to a heap based\n>   buffer overflow.\n> * CVE-2025-26597: Buffer overflow in XkbChangeTypesOfKey()\n>\n>   If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with 0 group, it will resize the key\n>   symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged.\n>   If later, the same function is called with a non-zero value of groups,\n>   this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong\n>   size.\n> * CVE-2025-26598: Out-of-bounds write in CreatePointerBarrierClient()\n>\n>   The function GetBarrierDevice() searches for the pointer device based on\n>   its device id and returns the matching value, or supposedly NULL if no\n>   match was found.\n>   However the code will return the last element of the list if no matching\n>   device id was found which can lead to out of bounds memory access.\n> * CVE-2025-26599: Use of uninitialized pointer in compRedirectWindow()\n>\n>   The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the backing\n>   pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a BadAlloc error\n>   without the validation of the window tree marked just before, which leaves\n>   the validate data partly initialized, and the use of an uninitialized pointer\n>   later.\n> * CVE-2025-26600: Use-after-free in PlayReleasedEvents()\n>\n>   When a device is removed while still frozen, the events queued for that\n>   device remain while the device itself is freed and replaying the events\n>   will cause a use after free.\n> * CVE-2025-26601: Use-after-free in SyncInitTrigger()\n>\n>   When changing an alarm, the values of the change mask are evaluated one\n>   after the other, changing the trigger values as requested and eventually,\n>   SyncInitTrigger() is called.\n>   If one of the changes triggers an error, the function will return early,\n>   not adding the new sync object.\n>   This can be used to cause a use after free when the alarm eventually\n>   triggers.",

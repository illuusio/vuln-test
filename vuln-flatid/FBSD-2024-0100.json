    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nIn ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND), the ID is always 0. When\npf is configured to allow ND and block incoming Echo Requests, a\ncrafted Echo Request packet after a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) can\ntrigger an Echo Reply. The packet has to come from the same host\nas the NS and have a zero as identifier to match the state created\nby the Neighbor Discovery and allow replies to be generated.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nICMPv6 packets with identifier value of zero bypass firewall\nrules written on the assumption that the incoming packets are going\nto create a state in the state table.\n\nNote:\n=====\n\nThis advisory introduced additional issues that were addressed by\nFreeBSD-EN-24:16.pf. Please refer to that erratum for additional\nfixes.",

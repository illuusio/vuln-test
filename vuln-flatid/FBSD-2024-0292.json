    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\n`bhyveload -h <host-path>` may be used to grant loader access\nto the <host-path> directory tree on the host. Affected versions\nof bhyveload(8) do not make any attempt to restrict loader's access\nto <host-path>, allowing the loader to read any file the host user\nhas access to.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIn the bhyveload(8) model, the host supplies a userboot.so to\nboot with, but the loader scripts generally come from the guest\nimage. A maliciously crafted script could be used to exfiltrate\nsensitive data from the host accessible to the user running\nbhyhveload(8), which is often the system root.",

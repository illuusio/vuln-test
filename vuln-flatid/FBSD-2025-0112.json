    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nIn some cases, the ktrace facility will log the contents of\nkernel structures to userspace. In one such case, ktrace dumps a\nvariable-sized sockaddr to userspace. There, the full sockaddr is\ncopied, even when it is shorter than the full size. This can result\nin up to 14 uninitialized bytes of kernel memory being copied out\nto userspace.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIt is possible for an unprivileged userspace program to leak\n14 bytes of a kernel heap allocation to userspace.",

    "details": "The ClamAV project reports:\n\n> CVE-2024-20290\n> :   A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV\n>     could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause\n>     a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected\n>     device. This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check\n>     for end-of-string values during scanning, which may\n>     result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could\n>     exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file\n>     containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an\n>     affected device. A successful exploit could allow the\n>     attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to\n>     terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected\n>     software and consuming available system resources.\n>\n> CVE-2024-20328\n> :   Fixed a possible command injection vulnerability in the\n>     \"VirusEvent\" feature of ClamAV's ClamD\n>     service. To fix this issue, we disabled the '%f' format\n>     string parameter. ClamD administrators may continue to\n>     use the `CLAM\\_VIRUSEVENT\\_FILENAME` environment variable,\n>     instead of '%f'. But you should do so only from within\n>     an executable, such as a Python script, and not directly\n>     in the clamd.conf \"VirusEvent\" command.",

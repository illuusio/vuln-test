    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nbhyve can be configured to emulate devices on a virtual USB\ncontroller (XHCI), such as USB tablet devices. An insufficient\nboundary validation in the USB code could lead to an out-of-bounds read\non the heap, which could potentially lead to an arbitrary write and\nremote code execution.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nA malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can exploit\nthe vulnerability to crash the hypervisor process or potentially achieve\ncode execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which\ntypically runs as root. Note that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so\nmalicious code is constrained by the capabilities available to the bhyve\nprocess.",

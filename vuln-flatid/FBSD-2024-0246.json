When a request's\n> headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the\n> excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker\n> to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header\n> data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.\n> These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly\n> more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to\n> send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames\n> we will process before closing a connection.",

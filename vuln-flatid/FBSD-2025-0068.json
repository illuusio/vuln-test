The SP does not support this, but\n> other implementers may have done so.\n>\n> Prior to updating, it is possible to mitigate the POST-SimpleSign\n> vulnerability by editing the protocols.xml configuration file and\n> removing this line:\n> `<Binding id=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST-SimpleSign\"\n> path=\"/SAML2/POST-SimpleSign\" />`",

This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2\n> endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all\n> associated with a request which is going to be\n> rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data\n> which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to\n> decode than for an attacker to send.",

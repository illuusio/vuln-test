summary: plasma[56]-plasma-workspace -- Unauthorized users can access session 
  manager
details: |-
  David Edmundson reports:

  > KSmserver, KDE's XSMP manager, incorrectly allows connections via ICE
  > based purely on the host, allowing all local connections. This allows
  > another user on the same machine to gain access to the session
  > manager.
  >
  > A well crafted client could use the session restore feature to execute
  > arbitrary code as the user on the next boot.

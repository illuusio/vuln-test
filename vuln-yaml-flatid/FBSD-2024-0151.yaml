summary: PostgreSQL -- Prevent unauthorized code execution during pg_dump
details: |-
  PostgreSQL project reports:

  > An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could
  > inject SQL code that would be executed by a concurrent pg\_dump
  > session with the privileges of the role running pg\_dump
  > (which is often a superuser). The attack involves replacing a
  > sequence or similar object with a view or foreign table that will
  > execute malicious code. To prevent this, introduce a new server
  > parameter restrict\_nonsystem\_relation\_kind that can disable
  > expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign
  > tables, and teach pg\_dump to set it when available. Note that the
  > attack is prevented only if both pg\_dump and the server it is
  > dumping from are new enough to have this fix.

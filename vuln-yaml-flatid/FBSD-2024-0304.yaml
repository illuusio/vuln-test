details: |-
  The ClamAV project reports:

  > CVE-2024-20290
  > :   A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV
  >     could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  >     a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  >     device. This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check
  >     for end-of-string values during scanning, which may
  >     result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could
  >     exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file
  >     containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an
  >     affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  >     attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to
  >     terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected
  >     software and consuming available system resources.
  >
  > CVE-2024-20328
  > :   Fixed a possible command injection vulnerability in the
  >     "VirusEvent" feature of ClamAV's ClamD
  >     service. To fix this issue, we disabled the '%f' format
  >     string parameter. ClamD administrators may continue to
  >     use the `CLAM\_VIRUSEVENT\_FILENAME` environment variable,
  >     instead of '%f'. But you should do so only from within
  >     an executable, such as a Python script, and not directly
  >     in the clamd.conf "VirusEvent" command.

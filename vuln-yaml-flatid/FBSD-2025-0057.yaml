summary: firefox -- multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  security@mozilla.org reports:

  > An attacker was able to bypass the `connect-src`
  > directive of a Content Security Policy by manipulating
  > subdocuments. This would have also hidden the connections
  > from the Network tab in Devtools.
  >
  > When Multi-Account Containers was enabled, DNS requests
  > could have bypassed a SOCKS proxy when the domain name was
  > invalid or the SOCKS proxy was not responding.
  >
  > If a user visited a webpage with an invalid TLS
  > certificate, and granted an exception, the webpage was able to
  > provide a WebAuthn challenge that the user would be prompted
  > to complete. This is in violation of the WebAuthN spec which
  > requires "a secure transport established without
  > errors".
  >
  > The exception page for the HTTPS-Only feature, displayed
  > when a website is opened via HTTP, lacked an anti-clickjacking
  > delay, potentially allowing an attacker to trick a user into
  > granting an exception and loading a webpage over HTTP.
  >
  > If a user saved a response from the Network tab in Devtools
  > using the Save As context menu option, that file may not have
  > been saved with the `.download` file extension.
  > This could have led to the user inadvertently running a
  > malicious executable.
  >
  > Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 139 and Thunderbird
  > 139. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
  > and we presume that with enough effort some of these could
  > have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

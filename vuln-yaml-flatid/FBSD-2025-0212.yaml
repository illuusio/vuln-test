  SO-AND-SO reports:

  > Unit 1.34.2 fixes two issues in the Java language module websocket code.
  >
  > 1. It addresses a potential security issue where we could get a negative
  >    payload length that could cause the Java language module process(es) to
  >    enter an infinite loop and consume excess CPU. This was a bug carried
  >    over from the initial Java websocket code import. It has been re-issued
  >    a CVE number (CVE-2025-1695).
  > 2. It addresses an issue whereby decoded payload lengths would be limited
  >    to 32 bits.

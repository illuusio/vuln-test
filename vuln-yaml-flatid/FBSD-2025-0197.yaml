summary: shibboleth-sp -- Parameter manipulation allows the forging of signed 
  SAML messages
details: |-
  The Shibboleth Project reports:

  > An updated version of the OpenSAML C++ library is available
  > which corrects a parameter manipulation vulnerability when using
  > SAML bindings that rely on non-XML signatures. The Shibboleth
  > Service Provider is impacted by this issue, and it manifests as
  > a critical security issue in that context.
  >
  > Parameter manipulation allows the forging of signed SAML messages
  >
  > A number of vulnerabilities in the OpenSAML library used by the
  > Shibboleth Service Provider allowed for creative manipulation of
  > parameters combined with reuse of the contents of older requests
  > to fool the library's signature verification of non-XML based
  > signed messages.
  >
  > Most uses of that feature involve very low or
  > low impact use cases without critical security implications;
  > however, there are two scenarios that are much more critical,
  > one affecting the SP and one affecting some implementers who
  > have implemented their own code on top of our OpenSAML library
  > and done so improperly.
  >
  > The SP's support for the HTTP-POST-SimpleSign SAML binding for
  > Single Sign-On responses is its critical vulnerability, and it
  > is enabled by default (regardless of what one's published SAML
  > metadata may advertise).
  >
  > The other critical case involves a mistake that
  > does \*not\* impact the Shibboleth SP, allowing SSO to occur over
  > the HTTP-Redirect binding contrary to the plain language of the
  > SAML Browser SSO profile. The SP does not support this, but
  > other implementers may have done so.
  >
  > Prior to updating, it is possible to mitigate the POST-SimpleSign
  > vulnerability by editing the protocols.xml configuration file and
  > removing this line:
  > `<Binding id="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST-SimpleSign"
  > path="/SAML2/POST-SimpleSign" />`

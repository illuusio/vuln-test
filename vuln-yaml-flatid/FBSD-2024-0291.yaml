summary: FreeBSD -- jail(2) information leak
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  The jail(2) system call has not limited a visiblity of allocated
  TTYs (the kern.ttys sysctl). This gives rise to an information
  leak about processes outside the current jail.

  Impact:
  =======

  Attacker can get information about TTYs allocated on the host
  or in other jails. Effectively, the information printed by "pstat
  -t" may be leaked.

summary: Unbound -- Denial of service attack
details: |-
  NLnet labs report:

  > A vulnerability has been discovered in Unbound when handling
  > replies with very large RRsets that Unbound needs to perform name
  > compression for.
  >
  > Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause
  > Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to
  > downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and
  > eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks.
  >
  > Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of
  > name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.
  > Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed
  > packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to
  > avoid locking the CPU for long.
  >
  > This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.

  may lead to unexpected behavior
details: |-
  cna@mongodb.com reports:

  > An authenticated user may trigger a use after free that may result
  > in MongoDB Server crash and other unexpected behavior, even if the
  > user does not have authorization to shut down a server. The crash
  > is triggered on affected versions by issuing an aggregation framework
  > operation using a specific combination of rarely-used aggregation
  > pipeline expressions. This issue affects MongoDB Server v6.0 version
  > prior to 6.0.21, MongoDB Server v7.0 version prior to 7.0.17 and
  > MongoDB Server v8.0 version prior to 8.0.4 when the SBE engine is

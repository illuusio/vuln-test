summary: Grafana -- User deletion issue
details: |-
  Grafana Labs reports:

  > On April 15, we discovered a vulnerability that stems from the user
  > deletion logic associated with organization administrators.
  > An organization admin could remove any user from the specific
  > organization they manage. Additionally, they have the power to delete
  > users entirely from the system if they have no other org membership.
  > This leads to two situations:
  >
  > 1. They can delete a server admin if the organization
  >    the Organization Admin manages is the server adminâ€™s final
  >    organizational membership.
  > 2. They can delete any user (regardless of whether they are a server
  >    admin or not) if that user currently belongs to no organizations.
  >
  > These two situations allow an organization manager to disrupt
  > instance-wide activity by continually deleting server administrators
  > if there is only one organization or if the server administrators are
  > not part of any organization.
  >
  > The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.5 Medium.

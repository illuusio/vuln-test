summary: Grafana -- Bypass Viewer and Editor permissions
details: |-
  Grafana Labs reports:

  > During the development of a new feature in Grafana 11.6.x,
  > a security vulnerability was introduced that allows for Viewers
  > and Editors to bypass dashboard-specific permissions. As a result,
  > users with the Viewer role could view all the dashboards within their
  > org and users with the Editor role could view, edit, and delete all
  > the dashboards in their org.
  >
  > *Note: Organization isolation boundaries still apply, which
  > means viewers and editors in one organization cannot view or edit
  > dashboards in another org. Also this vulnerability does not allow
  > users to query data via data sources they donâ€™t have access to.*
  >
  > The CVSS score for this vulnerability is
  > [8.3 HIGH](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L&version=3.1).

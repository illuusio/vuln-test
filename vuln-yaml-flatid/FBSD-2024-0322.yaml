details: |-
  The X.Org project reports:

  > * CVE-2023-6816: Heap buffer overflow in DeviceFocusEvent
  >   and ProcXIQueryPointer
  >
  >   Both DeviceFocusEvent and the XIQueryPointer reply contain a bit
  >   for each logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily
  >   mapped to any value up to 255 but the X.Org Server was only
  >   allocating space for the device's number of buttons,
  >   leading to a heap overflow if a bigger value was used.
  > * CVE-2024-0229: Reattaching to different master device may lead
  >   to out-of-bounds memory access
  >
  >   If a device has both a button class and a key class and
  >   numButtons is zero, we can get an out-of-bounds write due
  >   to event under-allocation in the DeliverStateNotifyEvent
  >   function.
  > * CVE-2024-21885: Heap buffer overflow in
  >   XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent
  >
  >   The XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent() function allocates space to
  >   store up to MAXDEVICES (256) xXIHierarchyInfo structures in info.
  >   If a device with a given ID was removed and a new device with
  >   the same ID added both in the same operation,
  >   the single device ID will lead to two info structures being
  >   written to info.
  >   Since this case can occur for every device ID at once,
  >   a total of two times MAXDEVICES info structures might be written
  >   to the allocation, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
  > * CVE-2024-21886: Heap buffer overflow in DisableDevice
  >
  >   The DisableDevice() function is called whenever an enabled device
  >   is disabled and it moves the device from the inputInfo.devices
  >   linked list to the inputInfo.off\_devices linked list.
  >   However, its link/unlink operation has an issue during the recursive
  >   call to DisableDevice() due to the prev pointer pointing to a
  >   removed device.
  >   This issue leads to a length mismatch between the total number of
  >   devices and the number of device in the list, leading to a heap
  >   overflow and, possibly, to local privilege escalation.

summary: Grafana -- Data source permission escalation
details: |-
  Grafana Labs reports:

  > The vulnerability impacts Grafana Cloud and Grafana Enterprise instances,
  > and it is exploitable if a user who should not be able to access all data
  > sources is granted permissions to create a data source.
  >
  > By default, only organization Administrators are allowed to create a data
  > source and have full access to all data sources. All other users need to be
  > explicitly granted permission to create a data source, which then means they
  > could exploit this vulnerability.
  >
  > When a user creates a data source via the
  > [API](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/data_source/#create-a-data-source),
  > they can specify data source UID. If the UID is set to an asterisk (\*),
  > the user gains permissions to query, update, and delete all data sources
  > in the organization. The exploit, however, does not stretch across
  > organizations â€” to exploit the vulnerability in several organizations, a user
  > would need permissions to create data sources in each organization.
  >
  > The vulnerability comes from a lack of UID validation. When evaluating
  > permissions, we interpret an asterisk (\*) as a wild card for all resources.
  > Therefore, we should treat it as a reserved value, and not allow the creation
  > of a resource with the UID set to an asterisk.

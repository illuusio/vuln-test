summary: minio -- privilege escalation via permissions inheritance
details: |-
  Minio security advisory GHSA-xx8w-mq23-29g4 ports:

  > When someone creates an access key, it inherits the
  > permissions of the parent key. Not only for s3:\* actions,
  > but also admin:\* actions. Which means unless somewhere
  > above in the access-key hierarchy, the admin rights are
  > denied, access keys will be able to simply override their
  > own s3 permissions to something more permissive.

summary: postgresql-server -- non-owner REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY 
  executes arbitrary SQL
details: |-
  PostgreSQL Project reports:

  > One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under
  > weak security restrictions. If a materialized view's
  > owner could persuade a superuser or other
  > high-privileged user to perform a concurrent refresh on
  > that view, the view's owner could control code executed
  > with the privileges of the user running REFRESH. The fix
  > for the vulnerability makes is so that all
  > user-determined code is run as the view's owner, as
  > expected.

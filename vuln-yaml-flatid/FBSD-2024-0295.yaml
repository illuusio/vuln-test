summary: phpmyfaq -- multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  phpMyFAQ team reports:

  > phpMyFAQ doesn't implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS when
  > storing on attachments filenames. The 'sharing FAQ' functionality
  > allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application
  > to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. phpMyFAQ's
  > user removal page allows an attacker to spoof another user's
  > detail, and in turn make a compelling phishing case for removing
  > another user's account.

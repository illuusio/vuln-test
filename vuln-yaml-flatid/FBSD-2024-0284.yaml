summary: Grafana -- Email verification is not required after email change
details: |-
  Grafana Labs reports:

  > The vulnerability impacts instances where
  > [Grafana basic authentication](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/grafana/) is enabled.
  >
  > Grafana has a
  > [verify\_email\_enabled](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#verify_email_enabled) configuration option. When this option is enabled,
  > users are required to confirm their email addresses before the sign-up process
  > is complete. However, the email is only checked at the time of the sign-up.
  > No further verification is carried out if a user’s email address is updated
  > after the initial sign-up. Moreover, Grafana allows using an email address
  > as the user’s login name, and no verification is ever carried out for this email
  > address.
  >
  > This means that even if the
  > [verify\_email\_enabled](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#verify_email_enabled) configuration option is enabled, users can use
  > unverified email addresses to log into Grafana if the email address
  > has been changed after the sign up, or if an email address is set as the login
  > name.
  >
  > The CVSS score for this vulnerability is [5.4 Medium] (CVSS).

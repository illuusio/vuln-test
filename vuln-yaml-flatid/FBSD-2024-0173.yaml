summary: Apache httpd -- Multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  The Apache httpd project reports:

  > DoS by Null pointer in websocket over HTTP/2 (CVE-2024-36387) (Low).
  > Serving WebSocket protocol upgrades over a HTTP/2 connection could
  > result in a Null Pointer dereference, leading to a crash of the server
  > process, degrading performance.
  >
  > Proxy encoding problem (CVE-2024-38473) (Moderate).
  > Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier
  > allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend
  > services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests.
  >
  > Weakness with encoded question marks in backreferences
  > (CVE-2024-38474) (Important). Substitution encoding issue in
  > mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker
  > to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but
  > not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts
  > meant to only to be executed as CGI.
  >
  > Weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches
  > filesystem path (CVE-2024-38475) (Important). Improper escaping of
  > output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows
  > an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to
  > be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable
  > by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.
  > Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables
  > as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe
  > RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag
  > "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the
  > substitution is appropriately constrained.
  >
  > may use exploitable/malicious backend application output to run local
  > handlers via internal redirect (CVE-2024-38476) (Important).
  > Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier are
  > vulnerable to information disclosure, SSRF or local script execution
  > via backend applications whose response headers are malicious or
  > exploitable.
  >
  > Crash resulting in Denial of Service in mod\_proxy via a malicious
  > request (CVE-2024-38477) (Important). Null pointer dereference in
  > mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker
  > to crash the server via a malicious request.
  >
  > mod\_rewrite proxy handler substitution (CVE-2024-39573) (Moderate).
  > Potential SSRF in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier
  > allows an attacker to cause unsafe RewriteRules to unexpectedly setup
  > URL's to be handled by mod\_proxy.

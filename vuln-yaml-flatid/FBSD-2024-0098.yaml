summary: FreeBSD -- NFS client accepts file names containing path separators
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  When mounting a remote filesystem using NFS, the kernel did not
  sanitize remotely provided filenames for the path separator character,
  "/". This allows readdir(3) and related functions to return
  filesystem entries with names containing additional path components.

  Impact:
  =======

  The lack of validation described above gives rise to a confused
  deputy problem. For example, a program copying files from an NFS
  mount could be tricked into copying from outside the intended source
  directory, and/or to a location outside the intended destination
  directory.

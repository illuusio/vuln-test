summary: forgejo -- HTTP/2 CONTINUATION flood in net/http
details: |-
  security@golang.org reports:

  > An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts
  > of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.
  > Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS
  > and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's
  > headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the
  > excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker
  > to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header
  > data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.
  > These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly
  > more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to
  > send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames
  > we will process before closing a connection.

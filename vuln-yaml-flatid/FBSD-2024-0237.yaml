  Błażej Pawłowski reports:

  > A vulnerability in the HTML parser of ClamAV could allow
  > an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
  > service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
  > vulnerability is due to an issue in the C to Rust foreign
  > function interface. An attacker could exploit this
  > vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing HTML
  > content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An
  > exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV
  > scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS
  > condition on the affected software.

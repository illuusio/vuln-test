details: |-
  The ClamAV project reports:

  > CVE-2024-20505
  > :   A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module of Clam
  >     AntiVirus (ClamAV) could allow an unauthenticated,
  >     remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  >     condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is
  >     due to an out of bounds read. An attacker could exploit
  >     this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to
  >     be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An exploit
  >     could allow the attacker to terminate the scanning
  >     process.

  > CVE-2024-20506
  > :   A vulnerability in the ClamD service module of Clam
  >     AntiVirus (ClamAV) could allow an authenticated, local
  >     attacker to corrupt critical system files. The
  >     vulnerability is due to allowing the ClamD process to
  >     write to its log file while privileged without checking
  >     if the logfile has been replaced with a symbolic
  >     link. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if
  >     they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a
  >     critical system file and then find a way to restart the
  >     ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to
  >     corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log
  >     messages after restart.

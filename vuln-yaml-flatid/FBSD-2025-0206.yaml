summary: xorg server -- Multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  The X.Org project reports:

  > * CVE-2025-26594: Use-after-free of the root cursor
  >
  >   The root cursor is referenced in the xserver as a global variable. If
  >   a client manages to free the root cursor, the internal reference points
  >   to freed memory and causes a use-after-free.
  > * CVE-2025-26595: Buffer overflow in XkbVModMaskText()
  >
  >   The code in XkbVModMaskText() allocates a fixed sized buffer on the
  >   stack and copies the names of the virtual modifiers to that buffer.
  >   The code however fails to check the bounds of the buffer correctly and
  >   would copy the data regardless of the size, which may lead to a buffer
  >   overflow.
  > * CVE-2025-26596: Heap overflow in XkbWriteKeySyms()
  >
  >   The computation of the length in XkbSizeKeySyms() differs from what is
  >   actually written in XkbWriteKeySyms(), which may lead to a heap based
  >   buffer overflow.
  > * CVE-2025-26597: Buffer overflow in XkbChangeTypesOfKey()
  >
  >   If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with 0 group, it will resize the key
  >   symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged.
  >   If later, the same function is called with a non-zero value of groups,
  >   this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong
  >   size.
  > * CVE-2025-26598: Out-of-bounds write in CreatePointerBarrierClient()
  >
  >   The function GetBarrierDevice() searches for the pointer device based on
  >   its device id and returns the matching value, or supposedly NULL if no
  >   match was found.
  >   However the code will return the last element of the list if no matching
  >   device id was found which can lead to out of bounds memory access.
  > * CVE-2025-26599: Use of uninitialized pointer in compRedirectWindow()
  >
  >   The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the backing
  >   pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a BadAlloc error
  >   without the validation of the window tree marked just before, which leaves
  >   the validate data partly initialized, and the use of an uninitialized pointer
  >   later.
  > * CVE-2025-26600: Use-after-free in PlayReleasedEvents()
  >
  >   When a device is removed while still frozen, the events queued for that
  >   device remain while the device itself is freed and replaying the events
  >   will cause a use after free.
  > * CVE-2025-26601: Use-after-free in SyncInitTrigger()
  >
  >   When changing an alarm, the values of the change mask are evaluated one
  >   after the other, changing the trigger values as requested and eventually,
  >   SyncInitTrigger() is called.
  >   If one of the changes triggers an error, the function will return early,
  >   not adding the new sync object.
  >   This can be used to cause a use after free when the alarm eventually
  >   triggers.

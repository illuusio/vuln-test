summary: firefox -- multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  security@mozilla.org reports:

  > * Firefox adds web-compatibility shims in place of some
  >   tracking scripts blocked by Enhanced Tracking Protection.
  >   On a site protected by Content Security Policy in
  >   "strict-dynamic" mode, an attacker able to
  >   inject an HTML element could have used a DOM
  >   Clobbering attack on some of the shims and achieved XSS,
  >   bypassing the CSP strict-dynamic protection.
  > * Form validation popups could capture escape key presses.
  >   Therefore, spamming form validation messages could be used
  >   to prevent users from exiting full-screen mode.
  > * When almost out-of-memory an elliptic curve key which
  >   was never allocated could have been freed again.
  > * It was possible to move the cursor using pointerlock
  >   from an iframe. This allowed moving the cursor outside
  >   of the viewport and the Firefox window.

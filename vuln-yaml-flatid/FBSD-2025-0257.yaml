summary: openvpn -- too long a username or password from a client can confuse 
  openvpn servers
details: |-
  Frank Lichtenheld reports:

  > [OpenVPN v2.6.13 ...] improve server-side handling of clients sending
  > usernames or passwords longer than USER\_PASS\_LEN - this would not
  > result in a crash, buffer overflow or other security issues, but the
  > server would then misparse incoming IV variables and produce misleading
  > error messages.

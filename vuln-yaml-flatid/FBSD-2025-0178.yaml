  security@mozilla.org reports:

  > CVE-2025-1938: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 135,
  > Thunderbird 135, Firefox ESR 128.7, and Thunderbird 128.7.
  > Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and
  > we presume that with enough effort some of these could have
  > been exploited to run arbitrary code.
  >
  > CVE-2025-1935: A web page could trick a user into setting
  > that site as the default handler for a custom URL protocol.
  >
  > CVE-2025-1934: It was possible to interrupt the processing
  > of a RegExp bailout and run additional JavaScript, potentially
  > triggering garbage collection when the engine was not
  > expecting it.

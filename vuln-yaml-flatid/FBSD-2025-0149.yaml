summary: redis,valkey -- DoS Vulnerability due to unlimited growth of output 
  buffers abused by unauthenticated client
details: |-
  Axel Mierczuk reports:

  > By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the
  > output buffer of normal clients (see
  > client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer
  > can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service
  > is exhausted and the memory is unavailable.
  >
  > When password authentication is enabled on the Redis
  > server, but no password is provided, the client can still
  > cause the output buffer to grow from "NOAUTH" responses
  > until the system will run out of memory.

  security@mozilla.org reports:

  > A bug in WebAssembly code generation could have lead to a crash.
  > It may have been possible for an attacker to leverage this to achieve
  > code execution.
  >
  > A race condition could have led to private browsing tabs being
  > opened in normal browsing windows. This could have resulted in a
  > potential privacy leak.
  >
  > Certificate length was not properly checked when added to a certificate
  > store. In practice only trusted data was processed.
  >
  > Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 134, Thunderbird 134, Firefox
  > ESR 128.6, and Thunderbird 128.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence
  > of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some
  > of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

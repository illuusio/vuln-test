summary: FreeBSD -- Use-after-free in multi-threaded xz decoder
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  A worker thread could free its input buffer after decoding,
  while the main thread might still be writing to it. This leads to
  an use-after-free condition on heap memory.

  Impact:
  =======

  An attacker may use specifically crafted .xz file to cause
  multi-threaded xz decoder to crash, or potentially run arbitrary
  code under the credential the decoder was executed.

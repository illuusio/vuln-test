summary: FreeBSD -- ktrace(2) fails to detach when executing a setuid binary
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  A logic bug in the code which disables kernel tracing for setuid
  programs meant that tracing was not disabled when it should have,
  allowing unprivileged users to trace and inspect the behavior of
  setuid programs.

  Impact:
  =======

  The bug may be used by an unprivileged user to read the contents
  of files to which they would not otherwise have access, such as the
  local password database.

summary: www/varnish7 -- Denial of Service in HTTP/2
details: |-
  Varnish Development Team reports:

  > A denial of service attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers
  > that have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An attacker can create a
  > large number of streams and immediately reset them without ever
  > reaching the maximum number of concurrent streams allowed for the
  > session, causing the Varnish server to consume unnecessary
  > resources processing requests for which the response will not be
  > delivered.
  >
  > This attack is a variant of the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack, which was
  > partially handled as VSV00013.

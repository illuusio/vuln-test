  > CVE-2023-50868: The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155
  > when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause
  > a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via
  > DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the "NSEC3"
  > issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must
  > perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain
  > situations.

  > CVE-2023-50387: Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035,
  > 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial
  > of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka
  > the "KeyTrap" issue. One of the concerns is that, when
  > there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol
  > specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations
  > of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.

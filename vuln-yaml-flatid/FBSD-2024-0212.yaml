summary: dnsdist -- Transfer requests received over DoH can lead to a denial of 
  service
details: |-
  PowerDNS Security Advisory reports:

  > When incoming DNS over HTTPS support is enabled using the nghttp2 provider,
  > and queries are routed to a tcp-only or DNS over TLS backend, an attacker can
  > trigger an assertion failure in DNSdist by sending a request for a zone transfer (AXFR
  > or IXFR) over DNS over HTTPS, causing the process to stop and thus leading to a
  > Denial of Service. DNS over HTTPS is not enabled by default, and backends are using
  > plain DNS (Do53) by default.

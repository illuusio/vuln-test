  > * CVE-2024-45490: Calling function XML\_ParseBuffer with
  >   len < 0 without noticing and then calling XML\_GetBuffer
  >   will have XML\_ParseBuffer fail to recognize the problem
  >   and XML\_GetBuffer corrupt memory.
  >   With the fix, XML\_ParseBuffer now complains with error
  >   XML\_ERROR\_INVALID\_ARGUMENT just like sibling XML\_Parse
  >   has been doing since Expat 2.2.1, and now documented.
  >   Impact is denial of service to potentially artitrary code
  >   execution.
  > * CVE-2024-45491: Internal function dtdCopy can have an
  >   integer overflow for nDefaultAtts on 32-bit platforms
  >   (where UINT\_MAX equals SIZE\_MAX).
  >   Impact is denial of service to potentially artitrary code
  >   execution.
  > * CVE-2024-45492: Internal function nextScaffoldPart can
  >   have an integer overflow for m\_groupSize on 32-bit
  >   platforms (where UINT\_MAX equals SIZE\_MAX).
  >   Impact is denial of service to potentially artitrary code
  >   execution.

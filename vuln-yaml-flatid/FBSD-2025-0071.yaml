summary: MongoDB -- Pre-authentication Denial of Service Stack Overflow 
  Vulnerability in JSON Parsing via Excessive Recursion in MongoDB
details: |-
  cna@mongodb.com reports:

  > MongoDB Server may be susceptible to stack overflow due to JSON
  > parsing mechanism, where specifically crafted JSON inputs may induce
  > unwarranted levels of recursion, resulting in excessive stack space
  > consumption. Such inputs can lead to a stack overflow that causes
  > the server to crash which could occur pre-authorisation. This issue
  > affects MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.17 and MongoDB
  > Server v8.0 versions prior to 8.0.5.
  > The same issue affects MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to 6.0.21,
  > but an attacker can only induce denial of service after authenticating.

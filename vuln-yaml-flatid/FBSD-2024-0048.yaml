summary: FreeBSD -- Multiple issues in the bhyve hypervisor
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  Several vulnerabilities were found in the bhyve hypervisor's
  device models.

  The NVMe driver function nvme\_opc\_get\_log\_page is vulnerable to a
  buffer over- read from a guest-controlled value. (CVE-2024-51562)

  The virtio\_vq\_recordon function is subject to a time-of-check to
  time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. (CVE-2024-51563)

  A guest can trigger an infinite loop in the hda audio driver.
  (CVE-2024-51564)

  The hda driver is vulnerable to a buffer over-read from a
  guest-controlled value. (CVE-2024-51565)

  The NVMe driver queue processing is vulernable to guest-induced
  infinite loops. (CVE-2024-51566)

  Impact:
  =======

  Malicious guest virtual machines may be able to perform a denial
  of service (DoS) of the bhyve host, and may read memory within the
  bhyve process that they should not be able to access.

summary: www/varnish7 -- Request Smuggling Attack
details: |-
  The Varnish Development Team reports:

  > A client-side desync vulnerability can be triggered in Varnish Cache
  > and Varnish Enterprise. This vulnerability can be triggered under
  > specific circumstances involving malformed HTTP/1 requests.
  >
  > An attacker can abuse a flaw in Varnish's handling of chunked
  > transfer encoding which allows certain malformed HTTP/1 requests
  > to exploit improper framing of the message body to smuggle additional
  > requests. Specifically, Varnish incorrectly permits CRLF to be
  > skipped to delimit chunk boundaries.

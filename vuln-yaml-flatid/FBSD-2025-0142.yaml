summary: dnsdist -- Denial of service via crafted DoH exchange
details: |-
  security@open-xchange.com reports:

  > When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the
  > nghttp2provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by
  > crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an illegal memory
  > access (double-free) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial
  > of service. The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9
  > version. A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o
  > provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version.
  > We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue
  > to our attention.

  security@mozilla.org reports:

  > * CVE-2024-11692: An attacker could cause a select dropdown
  >   to be shown over another tab; this could have led to user
  >   confusion and possible spoofing attacks.
  > * CVE-2024-11696: The application failed to account for
  >   exceptions thrown by the `loadManifestFromFile` method during
  >   add-on signature verification. This flaw, triggered by an
  >   invalid or unsupported extension manifest, could have caused
  >   runtime errors that disrupted the signature validation process.
  >   As a result, the enforcement of signature validation for
  >   unrelated add-ons may have been bypassed. Signature validation
  >   in this context is used to ensure that third-party
  >   applications on the user's computer have not tampered
  >   with the user's extensions, limiting the impact of this
  >   issue.
  > * CVE-2024-11697: When handling keypress events, an attacker
  >   may have been able to trick a user into bypassing the "
  >   Open Executable File?" confirmation dialog. This could
  >   have led to malicious code execution.
  > * CVE-2024-11699: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 132,
  >   Firefox ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4. Some of these bugs
  >   showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
  >   enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run
  >   arbitrary code.

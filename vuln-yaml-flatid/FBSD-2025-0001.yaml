summary: nginx -- worker process memory disclosure
details: |-
  F5 reports:

  > NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in the
  > ngx\_mail\_smtp\_module that might allow an unauthenticated attacker to
  > over-read NGINX SMTP authentication process memory; as a result, the
  > server side may leak arbitrary bytes sent in a request to the
  > authentication server. This issue happens during the NGINX SMTP
  > authentication process and requires the attacker to make preparations
  > against the target system to extract the leaked data. The issue
  > affects NGINX only if (1) it is built with the ngx\_mail\_smtp\_module,
  > (2) the smtp\_auth directive is configured with method "none,"
  > and (3) the authentication server returns the "Auth-Wait" response
  > header.

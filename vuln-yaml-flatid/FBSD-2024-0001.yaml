summary: Apache Tomcat -- RCE due to TOCTOU issue in JSP compilation
details: |-
  security@apache.org reports:

  > Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
  > The mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete.
  > Users running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the
  > default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation parameter
  > set to the non-default value of false) may need additional configuration
  > to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which version of Java
  > they are using with Tomcat: - running on Java 8 or Java 11: the
  > system propertysun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false
  > (it defaults to true) - running on Java 17: thesystem property
  > sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false(it defaults to
  > false) - running on Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is
  > required(the system property and the problematic cache have been
  > removed)
  > Tomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks
  > thatsun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the
  > default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file
  > system. Tomcat will also setsun.io.useCanonCaches to false by
  > default where it can.

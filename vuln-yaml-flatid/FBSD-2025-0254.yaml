  The Go project reports:

  > crypto/x509: usage of IPv6 zone IDs can bypass URI name constraints
  >
  > A certificate with a URI which has a IPv6 address with a
  > zone ID may incorrectly satisfy a URI name constraint that
  > applies to the certificate chain.

  > net/http: sensitive headers incorrectly sent after cross-domain redirect
  >
  > The HTTP client drops sensitive headers after following a
  > cross-domain redirect. For example, a request to a.com/
  > containing an Authorization header which is redirected to
  > b.com/ will not send that header to b.com.

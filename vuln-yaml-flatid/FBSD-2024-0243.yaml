summary: PuTTY and embedders (f.i., filezilla) -- biased RNG with NIST 
  P521/ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 signatures permits recovering private key
details: |-
  Simon Tatham reports:

  > ECDSA signatures using 521-bit keys (the NIST P521 curve,
  > otherwise known as ecdsa-sha2-nistp521) were generated with biased
  > random numbers. This permits an attacker in possession of a few
  > dozen signatures to RECOVER THE PRIVATE KEY.
  >
  > Any 521-bit ECDSA private key that PuTTY or Pageant has used to
  > sign anything should be considered compromised.
  >
  > Additionally, if you have any 521-bit ECDSA private keys that
  > you've used with PuTTY, you should consider them to be
  > compromised: generate new keys, and remove the old public keys
  > from any authorized\_keys files.

  > A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator
  > of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login
  > or file copy), [...] and the victim uses the same private key for
  > SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here,
  > the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to
  > determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private
  > key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other
  > services. If the other services include Git services, then again it
  > may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software
  > maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before
  > 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and
  > TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.

summary: FreeBSD -- Certificate revocation list fetch(1) option fails
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  The fetch(3) library uses environment variables for passing
  certain information, including the revocation file pathname. The
  environment variable name used by fetch(1) to pass the filename to
  the library was incorrect, in effect ignoring the option.

  Impact:
  =======

  Fetch would still connect to a host presenting a certificate
  included in the revocation file passed to the --crl option.

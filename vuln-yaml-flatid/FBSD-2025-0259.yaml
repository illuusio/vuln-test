  > CVE-2024-50349: Printing unsanitized URLs when asking for credentials made the
  > user susceptible to crafted URLs (e.g. in recursive clones) that
  > mislead the user into typing in passwords for trusted sites that
  > would then be sent to untrusted sites instead.
  >
  > CVE-2024-52006: Git may pass on Carriage Returns via the credential protocol to
  > credential helpers which use line-reading functions that
  > interpret said Carriage Returns as line endings, even though Git
  > did not intend that.

summary: SnappyMail -- multiple mXSS in HTML sanitizer
details: |-
  Oskar reports:

  > SnappyMail uses the `cleanHtml()` function to cleanup HTML
  > and CSS in emails. Research discovered that the function
  > has a few bugs which cause an mXSS exploit. Because the
  > function allowed too many (invalid) HTML elements, it was
  > possible (with incorrect markup) to trick the browser to
  > "fix" the broken markup into valid markup. As a result a
  > motivated attacker may be able to inject javascript.

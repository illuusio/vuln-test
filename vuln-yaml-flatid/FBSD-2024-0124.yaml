summary: FreeBSD -- Multiple vulnerabilities in libnv
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  CVE-2024-45287 is a vulnerability that affects both the kernel
  and userland. A malicious value of size in a structure of packed
  libnv can cause an integer overflow, leading to the allocation of
  a smaller buffer than required for the parsed data.

  CVE-2024-45288 is a vulnerability that affects both the kernel and
  userland. A missing null-termination character in the last element
  of an nvlist array string can lead to writing outside the allocated
  buffer.

  Impact:
  =======

  It is possible for an attacker to overwrite portions of memory
  (in userland or the kernel) as the allocated buffer might be smaller
  than the data received from a malicious process. This vulnerability
  could result in privilege escalation or cause a system panic.

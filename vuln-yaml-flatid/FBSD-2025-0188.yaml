  > Multiple vulnerabilities

  * CVE-2025-29915: Severity HIGH. The AF\_PACKET defrag option
    is enabled by default and allows AF\_PACKET to re-assemble
    fragmented packets before reaching Suricata. However the
    default packet size in Suricata is based on the network
    interface MTU which leads to Suricata seeing truncated
    packets.
  * CVE-2025-29916: Severity Moderate. Datasets declared in
    rules have an option to specify the `hashsize` to use.
    This size setting isn't properly limited, so the hash
    table allocation can be large. Untrusted rules can lead to
    large memory allocations, potentially leading to denial of
    service due to resource starvation
  * CVE-2025-29917: Severity HIGH. The bytes setting in the
    decode\_base64 keyword is not properly limited. Due to
    this, signatures using the keyword and setting can cause
    large memory allocations of up to 4 GiB per thread.
  * CVE-2025-29918: Severity HIGH. A PCRE rule can be written
    that leads to an infinite loop when negated PCRE is used.
    Packet processing thread becomes stuck in infinite loop
    limiting visibility and availability in inline mode.

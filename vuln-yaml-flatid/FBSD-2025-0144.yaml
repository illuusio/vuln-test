summary: sqlite -- integer overflow
details: |-
  cve@mitre.org reports:

  > In SQLite 3.44.0 through 3.49.0 before 3.49.1, the
  > concat\_ws() SQL function can cause memory to be written
  > beyond the end of a malloc-allocated buffer. If the
  > separator argument is attacker-controlled and has a large
  > string (e.g., 2MB or more), an integer overflow occurs in
  > calculating the size of the result buffer, and thus malloc
  > may not allocate enough memory.

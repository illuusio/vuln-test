  Vulnerability
details: |-
  zdi-disclosures@trendmicro.com reports:

  > GIMP FLI File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution
  > Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
  > arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction
  > is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must
  > visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
  > The specific flaw exists within the parsing of FLI files. The issue
  > results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
  > which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer.

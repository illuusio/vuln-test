summary: Intel CPUs -- multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  Intel reports:

  > Potential security vulnerabilities in some Intel Trust Domain
  > Extensions (TDX) module software may allow escalation of
  > privilege. Improper input validation in some Intel TDX module
  > software before version 1.5.05.46.698 may allow a privileged user to
  > potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. Intel
  > is releasing firmware updates to mitigate these potential
  > vulnerabilities.

  > A potential security vulnerability in some Intel Processors may
  > allow information disclosure. Hardware logic contains race
  > conditions in some Intel Processors that may allow an authenticated
  > user to potentially enable partial information disclosure via local
  > access. Intel is releasing microcode updates to mitigate this
  > potential vulnerability.

  > A potential security vulnerability in Intel Core Ultra Processors
  > may allow denial of service. Sequence of processor instructions
  > leads to unexpected behavior in Intel Core Ultra Processors may
  > allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service
  > via local access. Intel is releasing microcode updates to mitigate
  > this potential vulnerability.

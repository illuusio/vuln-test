summary: FreeBSD -- bhyveload(8) host file access
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  `bhyveload -h <host-path>` may be used to grant loader access
  to the <host-path> directory tree on the host. Affected versions
  of bhyveload(8) do not make any attempt to restrict loader's access
  to <host-path>, allowing the loader to read any file the host user
  has access to.

  Impact:
  =======

  In the bhyveload(8) model, the host supplies a userboot.so to
  boot with, but the loader scripts generally come from the guest
  image. A maliciously crafted script could be used to exfiltrate
  sensitive data from the host accessible to the user running
  bhyhveload(8), which is often the system root.

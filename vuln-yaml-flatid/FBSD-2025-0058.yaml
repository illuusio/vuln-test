summary: firefox -- multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  security@mozilla.org reports:

  > Firefox could have incorrectly parsed a URL and rewritten
  > it to the youtube.com domain when parsing the URL specified
  > in an `embed` tag. This could have bypassed website security
  > checks that restricted which domains users were allowed to
  > embed.
  >
  > When a file download is specified via the
  > `Content-Disposition` header, that directive would be ignored
  > if the file was included via a `&lt;embed&gt;` or
  > `&lt;object&gt;` tag, potentially making a website
  > vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

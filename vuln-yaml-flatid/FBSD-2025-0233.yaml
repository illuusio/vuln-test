  security@mozilla.org reports:

  > The Thunderbird Address Book URI fields contained unsanitized links.
  > This could be used by an attacker to create and export an address
  > book containing a malicious payload in a field. For example, in
  > the Other field of the Instant Messaging section. If another user
  > imported the address book, clicking on the link could result in
  > opening a web page inside Thunderbird, and that page could execute

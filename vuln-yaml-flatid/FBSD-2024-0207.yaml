summary: Arti -- Security issues related to circuit construction
details: |-
  Tor Project reports:

  > When building anonymizing circuits to or from an onion
  > service with 'lite' vanguards (the default) enabled, the
  > circuit manager code would build the circuits with one
  > hop too few.
  >
  > When 'full' vanguards are enabled, some circuits are
  > supposed to be built with an extra hop to minimize the
  > linkability of the guard nodes. In some circumstances,
  > the circuit manager would build circuits with one hop
  > too few, making it easier for an adversary to discover
  > the L2 and L3 guards of the affected clients and
  > services.

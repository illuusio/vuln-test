summary: forgejo -- multiple vulnerabilities
details: |-
  Problem Description:
  ====================

  * Forgejo generates a token which is used to authenticate web
    endpoints that are only meant to be used internally, for instance
    when the SSH daemon is used to push a commit with Git. The
    verification of this token was not done in constant time and was
    susceptible to timing attacks. A pre-condition for such an attack is
    the precise measurements of the time for each operation. Since it
    requires observing the timing of network operations, the issue is
    mitigated when a Forgejo instance is accessed over the internet
    because the ISP introduce unpredictable random delays.
  * Because of a missing permission check, the branch used to propose
    a pull request to a repository can always be deleted by the user
    performing the merge. It was fixed so that such a deletion is only
    allowed if the user performing the merge has write permission to the
    repository from which the pull request was made.

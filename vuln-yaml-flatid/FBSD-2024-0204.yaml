summary: Openfire administration console authentication bypass
details: |-
  security-advisories@github.com reports:

  > Openfire's administrative console, a web-based
  > application, was found to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack
  > via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated user
  > to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already
  > configured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the
  > Openfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users. This
  > vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been
  > released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. The problem
  > has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further
  > improvements will be included in the yet-to-be released first version
  > on the 4.8 branch (which is expected to be version 4.8.0). Users
  > are advised to upgrade. If an Openfire upgrade isnt available for
  > a specific release, or isnt quickly actionable, users may see the
  > linked github advisory (GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm) for mitigation advice.

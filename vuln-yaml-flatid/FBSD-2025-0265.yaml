summary: Perl -- heap buffer overflow when transliterating non-ASCII bytes
details: |-
  9b29abf9-4ab0-4765-b253-1875cd9b441e reports:

  > A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl.
  > When there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the `tr`
  > operator, `S\_do\_trans\_invmap` can overflow the destination pointer
  > `d`.
  > $ perl -e '$\_ = "\x{FF}" x 1000000; tr/\xFF/\x{100}/;'
  > Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  > It is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of
  > Service and possibly Code Execution attacks on platforms that
  > lack sufficient defenses.

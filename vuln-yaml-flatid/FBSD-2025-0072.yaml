summary: kanboard -- Password Reset Poisoning via Host Header Injection
details: |-
  GitHub Security Advisories reports:

  > Kanboard allows password reset emails to be sent with URLs
  > derived from the unvalidated Host header when the
  > application\_url configuration is unset (default behavior).
  > This allows an attacker to craft a malicious password
  > reset link that leaks the token to an attacker-controlled
  > domain. If a victim (including an administrator) clicks
  > the poisoned link, their account can be taken over. This
  > affects all users who initiate a password reset while
  > application\_url is not set.

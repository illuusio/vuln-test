summary: grafana -- XSS vulnerability
details: |-
  security@grafana.com reports:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Grafana caused
  > by combining a client path traversal and open redirect. This allows
  > attackers to redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend
  > plugin that will execute arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability
  > does not require editor permissions and if anonymous access is
  > enabled, the XSS will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin
  > is installed, it is possible to exploit the open redirect to achieve
  > a full read SSRF.
  > The default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the
  > XSS though the `connect-src` directive.

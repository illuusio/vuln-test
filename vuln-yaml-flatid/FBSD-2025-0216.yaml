  Kevin Backhouse reports:

  > A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4.
  > Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are not affected. Exiv2 is a
  > command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and
  > modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when
  > Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker
  > could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if
  > they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.
  >
  > Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which
  > is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For
  > example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
  > need to add an extra command-line argument such as fixiso.

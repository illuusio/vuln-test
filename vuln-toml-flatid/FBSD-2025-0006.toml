p5-Authen-SASL project reports:

> Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST\\_MD5 versions 2.04 through 2.1800 for Perl generates the cnonce insecurely.
>
> The cnonce (client nonce) is generated from an MD5 hash of the PID, the epoch time and the built-in rand function.
> The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header.
> The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.
>
> According to RFC 2831, The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string value provided by the client and used by both client and server
> to avoid chosen plaintext attacks, and to provide mutual authentication. The security of the implementation depends on a good choice.
> It is RECOMMENDED that it contain at least 64 bits of entropy."""

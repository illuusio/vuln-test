    "details": "The freedesktop.org project reports:\n\n> The functions XGetFontPath, XListExtensions, and XListFonts are\n> vulnerable to an off-by-one override on malicious server responses.\n> The server replies consist of chunks consisting of a length byte\n> followed by actual string, which is not NUL-terminated.\n> While parsing the response, the length byte is overridden with '\\0',\n> thus the memory area can be used as storage of C strings later on.\n> To be able to NUL-terminate the last string, the buffer is reserved\n> with an additional byte of space. For a boundary check, the variable\n> chend (end of ch) was introduced, pointing at the end of the buffer\n> which ch initially points to. Unfortunately there is a difference\n> in handling \"the end of ch\". While chend points at the first byte\n> that must not be written to, the for-loop uses chend as the last\n> byte that can be written to. Therefore, an off-by-one can occur.\n>\n> The length value is interpreted as signed char on many systems\n> (depending on default signedness of char), which can lead to an out\n> of boundary write up to 128 bytes in front of the allocated storage,\n> but limited to NUL byte(s).\n>\n> If the server sends a reply in which even the first string would\n> overflow the transmitted bytes, list[0] (or flist[0]) will be set to\n> NULL and a count of 0 is returned. If the resulting list is freed\n> with XFreeExtensionList or XFreeFontPath later on, the first Xfree\n> call is turned into Xfree (NULL-1) which will most likely trigger a\n> segmentation fault. Casting the length value to unsigned char fixes\n> the problem and allows string values with up to 255 characters.",

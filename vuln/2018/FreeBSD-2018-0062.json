This could have\n> exposed resources to users who were not authorised to access them.\n\n> The URL pattern of \\\"\\\" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the\n> context root was not correctly handled when used as part of a security\n> constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It\n> was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web\n> application resources that should have been protected. Only security\n> constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.\n",

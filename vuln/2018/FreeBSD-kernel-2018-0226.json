That means an attacker would need valid\n> credentials for the application to log in or needs to exploit an\n> additional vulnerability of which we are not aware of at this point\n> of time.\n>\n> An attacker would also be able to delete files on the system, if\n> the user running the application has the rights to do so.\n>\n> Does this issue affect me?\n>\n> Likely yes, if you are using Squirrelmail. We checked the latest\n> development version, which is 1.5.2-svn and the latest version\n> available for download at this point of time, 1.4.22. Both contain\n> the vulnerable code.",

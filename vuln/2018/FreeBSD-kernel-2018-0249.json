As with the previous issue, this flaw allows for\n> changes to an XML document that do not break a digital signature but\n> can alter the user data passed through to applications behind the SP\n> and result in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected\n> information.\n>\n> As before, the use of XML Encryption is a significant mitigation,\n> but we have not dismissed the possibility that attacks on the\n> Response \"envelope\" may be possible, in both the original and this\n> new case. No actual attacks of this nature are known, so deployers\n> should prioritize patching systems that expect to handle unencrypted\n> SAML assertions.\n>\n> An updated version of XMLTooling-C (V1.6.4) is available that\n> protects against these new attacks, and should help prevent similar\n> vulnerabilities in the future.\n>\n> Unlike the previous case, these bugs are NOT prevented by any\n> existing Xerces-C parser version on any platform and cannot be\n> addressed by any means other than the updated XMLTooling-C library.\n>\n> The Service Provider software relies on a generic XML parser to\n> process SAML responses and there are limitations in older versions\n> of the parser that make it impossible to fully disable Document Type\n> Definition (DTD) processing.\n>\n> Through addition/manipulation of a DTD, it's possible to make\n> changes to an XML document that do not break a digital signature but\n> are mishandled by the SP and its libraries. These manipulations can\n> alter the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and\n> result in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected\n> information.\n>\n> While newer versions of the xerces-c3 parser are configured by the\n> SP into disallowing the use of a DTD via an environment variable,\n> this feature is not present in the xerces-c3 parser before version\n> 3.1.4, so an additional fix is being provided now that an actual DTD\n> exploit has been identified. Xerces-c3-3.1.4 was committed to the\n> ports tree already on 2016-07-26.",

This could have exposed\n> resources to users who were not authorised to access them.\n\n> The URL pattern of \"\" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the\n> context root was not correctly handled when used as part of a security\n> constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was,\n> therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web\n> application resources that should have been protected.

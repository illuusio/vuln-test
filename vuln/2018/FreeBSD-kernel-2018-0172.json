    "details": "Corelight reports:\n\n> Bro 2.5.4 primarily fixes security issues\n>\n> Multiple fixes and improvements to BinPAC generated code related to array parsing, with potential impact to all Bro's BinPAC-generated analyzers in the form of buffer over-reads or other invalid memory accesses depending on whether a particular analyzer incorrectly assumed that the evaulated-array-length expression is actually the number of elements that were parsed out from the input.\n>\n> The NCP analyzer (not enabled by default and also updated to actually work with newer Bro APIs in the release) performed a memory allocation based directly on a field in the input packet and using signed integer storage. This could result in a signed integer overflow and memory allocations of negative or very large size, leading to a crash or memory exhaustion. The new NCP::max\\_frame\\_size tuning option now limits the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.",

The issue is due to the fact that some\n> memory is allocated before the parsing and is not always properly\n> released if the record is malformed. When the PowerDNS Authoritative\n> Server is run inside the guardian (\\--guardian), or inside a\n> supervisor like supervisord or systemd, an out-of-memory crash will\n> lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to a somewhat\n> degraded service.\n>\n> CVE-2018-14626: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative\n> Server allowing a remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an\n> answer without DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache and\n> be returned to clients asking for DNSSEC records, thus hiding the\n> presence of DNSSEC signatures for a specific qname and qtype. For a\n> DNSSEC-signed domain, this means that DNSSEC validating clients will\n> consider the answer to be bogus until it expires from the packet\n> cache, leading to a denial of service.\n",

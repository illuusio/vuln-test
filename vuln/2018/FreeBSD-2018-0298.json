The attacker must have access to the\n> phpMyAdmin Configuration Storage tables, although these can easily be\n> created in any database to which the attacker has access. An attacker\n> must have valid credentials to log in to phpMyAdmin; this\n> vulnerability does not allow an attacker to circumvent the login\n> system.\n>\n> ### Severity\n>\n> We consider this vulnerability to be severe.\n\n> ### Summary\n>\n> XSRF/CSRF vulnerability in phpMyAdmin\n>\n> ### Description\n>\n> By deceiving a user to click on a crafted URL, it is possible to\n> perform harmful SQL operations such as renaming databases, creating\n> new tables/routines, deleting designer pages, adding/deleting users,\n> updating user passwords, killing SQL processes, etc.\n>\n> ### Severity\n>\n> We consider this vulnerability to be of moderate severity.\n\n> ### Summary\n>\n> XSS vulnerability in navigation tree\n>\n> ### Description\n>\n> A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the navigation tree,\n> where an attacker can deliver a payload to a user through a\n> specially-crafted database/table name.\n>\n> ### Severity\n>\n> We consider this attack to be of moderate severity.\n>\n> ### Mitigation factor\n>\n> The stored XSS vulnerabilities can be triggered only by someone who\n> logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents\n> non-logged-in users from accessing the required forms.\n",

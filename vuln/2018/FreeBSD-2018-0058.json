Subsequent formulas can\n> operate on that inserted data and construct a remote URL whose path\n> leaks the local data to a remote attacker.\n>\n> In later versions of LibreOffice without this flaw, WEBSERVICE has now\n> been limited to accessing http and https URLs along with bringing\n> WEBSERVICE URLs under LibreOffice Calc\\'s link management\n> infrastructure.\n>\n> **Note:** This vulnerability has been identified upstream as\n> CVE-2018-1055, but NVD/Mitre are advising it\\'s a reservation\n> duplicate of CVE-2018-6871 which should be used instead.\n",

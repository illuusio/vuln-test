The issue is due to the fact that some memory is allocated\n> before the parsing and is not always properly released if the record is malformed.\n> When the PowerDNS Recursor is run inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd,\n> an out-of-memory crash will lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to\n> a somewhat degraded service.\n>\n> CVE-2018-14626: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor allowing a remote\n> user to craft a DNS query that will cause an answer without DNSSEC records to be\n> inserted into the packet cache and be returned to clients asking for DNSSEC\n> records, thus hiding the presence of DNSSEC signatures for a specific qname and\n> qtype. For a DNSSEC-signed domain, this means that clients performing DNSSEC\n> validation by themselves might consider the answer to be bogus until it expires\n> from the packet cache, leading to a denial of service.\n>\n> CVE-2018-14644: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where a remote attacker\n> sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached\n> as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all\n> the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at\n> least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting\n> DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.",

These manipulations can\n> alter the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and\n> result in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected\n> information.\n>\n> While newer versions of the xerces-c3 parser are configured by the\n> SP into disallowing the use of a DTD via an environment variable,\n> this feature is not present in the xerces-c3 parser before version\n> 3.1.4, so an additional fix is being provided now that an actual DTD\n> exploit has been identified. Xerces-c3-3.1.4 was committed to the\n> ports tree already on 2016-07-26.",

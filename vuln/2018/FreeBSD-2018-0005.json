These manipulations can alter\n> the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and result\n> in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected information.\n>\n> While newer versions of the xerces-c3 parser are configured by the SP\n> into disallowing the use of a DTD via an environment variable, this\n> feature is not present in the xerces-c3 parser before version 3.1.4,\n> so an additional fix is being provided now that an actual DTD exploit\n> has been identified. Xerces-c3-3.1.4 was committed to the ports tree\n> already on 2016-07-26.\n",

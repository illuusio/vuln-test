This integer overflow usually causes a very small\n> buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge\n> one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.\n>\n> This bug is very similar to CVE-2017-14618.\n>\n> It affects curl 7.33.0 to 7.61.1.\n>\n> CVE-2018-16840: use-after-free in handle close\n>\n> libcurl contains a heap use-after-free flaw in code related to closing\n> an easy handle.\n>\n> When closing and cleaning up an \\\"easy\\\" handle in the Curl_close()\n> function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the\n> pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct\n> field within that already freed struct.\n>\n> It affects curl 7.59.0 to 7.61.1.\n>\n> CVE-2018-16842: warning message out-of-buffer read\n>\n> curl contains a heap out of buffer read vulnerability.\n>\n> The command line tool has a generic function for displaying warning\n> and informational messages to stderr for various situations. For\n> example if an unknown command line argument is used, or passed to it\n> in a \\\"config\\\" file.\n>\n> This display function formats the output to wrap at 80 columns. The\n> wrap logic is however flawed, so if a single word in the message is\n> itself longer than 80 bytes the buffer arithmetic calculates the\n> remainder wrong and will end up reading behind the end of the buffer.\n> This could lead to information disclosure or crash.\n>\n> This vulnerability could lead to a security issue if used in this or\n> similar situations:\n>\n> 1\\. a server somewhere uses the curl command line to run something\n>\n> 2\\. if it fails, it shows stderr to the user\n>\n> 3\\. the server takes user input for parts of its command line input\n>\n> 4\\. user provides something overly long that triggers this crash\n>\n> 5\\. the stderr output may now contain user memory contents that\n> wasn\\'t meant to be available\n>\n> It affects curl 7.14.1 to 7.61.1.\n",

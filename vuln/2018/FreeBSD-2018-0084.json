That means an attacker would need valid\n> credentials for the application to log in or needs to exploit an\n> additional vulnerability of which we are not aware of at this point of\n> time.\n>\n> An attacker would also be able to delete files on the system, if the\n> user running the application has the rights to do so.\n>\n> Does this issue affect me?\n>\n> Likely yes, if you are using Squirrelmail.

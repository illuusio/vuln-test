So this should only affect very specific setups,\n>   but in such configurations all strongSwan versions since 5.0.1 may be affected.\n> * A denial-of-service vulnerability in the stroke plugin was fixed.\n>   When reading a message from the socket the plugin did not check the received length.\n>   Unless a group is configured, root privileges are required to access that socket,\n>   so in the default configuration this shouldn't be an issue, but all strongSwan versions may be affected.",

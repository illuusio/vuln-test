The WAV parser component contains a vulnerability that allows writing to memory because ParseRiffHeaderConfig in riff.c does not reject multiple format chunks.\n\n> An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier. The W64 parser component contains a vulnerability that allows writing to memory because ParseWave64HeaderConfig in wave64.c does not reject multiple format chunks.\n\n> An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for WAV input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseRiffHeaderConfig in riff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes\\_to\\_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.\n\n> An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input.

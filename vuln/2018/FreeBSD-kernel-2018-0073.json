    "details": "the Apache Spamassassin project reports:\n\n> In Apache SpamAssassin, using HTML::Parser, we setup an object and\n> hook into the begin and end tag event handlers In both cases, the\n> \"open\" event is immediately followed by a \"close\" event - even if\n> the tag \\*does not\\* close in the HTML being parsed.\n>\n> Because of this, we are missing the \"text\" event to deal with\n> the object normally. This can cause carefully crafted emails that\n> might take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial of\n> Service.\n>\n> Fix a reliance on \".\" in @INC in one configuration script. Whether\n> this can be exploited in any way is uncertain.\n>\n> Fix a potential Remote Code Execution bug with the PDFInfo plugin.\n> Thanks to cPanel Security Team for their report of this issue.\n>\n> Fourth, this release fixes a local user code injection in the\n> meta rule syntax. Thanks again to cPanel Security Team for their\n> report of this issue.",

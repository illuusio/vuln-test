Any website can simply create a dns name that they\n> are authorized to communicate with, and then make it resolve to\n> localhost.\n>\n> Exploitation is simple, you could set script-torrent-done-enabled and\n> run any command, or set download-dir to /home/user/ and then upload a\n> torrent for .bashrc.\n",

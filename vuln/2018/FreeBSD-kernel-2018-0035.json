The issue\n> is due to the fact that some memory is allocated before the parsing and is not\n> always properly released if the record is malformed. When the PowerDNS\n> Authoritative Server is run inside the guardian (--guardian), or inside a\n> supervisor like supervisord or systemd, an out-of-memory crash will lead to an\n> automatic restart, limiting the impact to a somewhat degraded service.\n>\n> CVE-2018-14626: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing\n> a remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an answer without DNSSEC\n> records to be inserted into the packet cache and be returned to clients asking for\n> DNSSEC records, thus hiding the presence of DNSSEC signatures for a specific qname\n> and qtype. For a DNSSEC-signed domain, this means that DNSSEC validating clients\n> will consider the answer to be bogus until it expires from the packet cache,\n> leading to a denial of service.",

So this should only\n>   affect very specific setups, but in such configurations all\n>   strongSwan versions since 5.0.1 may be affected.\n> - A denial-of-service vulnerability in the stroke plugin was fixed.\n>   When reading a message from the socket the plugin did not check the\n>   received length. Unless a group is configured, root privileges are\n>   required to access that socket, so in the default configuration this\n>   shouldn\\'t be an issue, but all strongSwan versions may be affected.\n",

The\n> contents and size of that overwrite is controllable by the server.\n>\n> This situation was detected by an assert() in the code, but that was\n> of course only preventing bad stuff in debug builds. This bug is very\n> unlikely to trigger with non-malicious servers.\n>\n> We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.\n>\n> CVE-2018-1000301: RTSP bad headers buffer over-read\n>\n> curl can be tricked into reading data beyond the end of a heap based\n> buffer used to store downloaded content.\n>\n> When servers send RTSP responses back to curl, the data starts out\n> with a set of headers. curl parses that data to separate it into a\n> number of headers to deal with those appropriately and to find the end\n> of the headers that signal the start of the \\\"body\\\" part.\n>\n> The function that splits up the response into headers is called\n> Curl_http_readwrite_headers() and in situations where it can\\'t find a\n> single header in the buffer, it might end up leaving a pointer\n> pointing into the buffer instead of to the start of the buffer which\n> then later on may lead to an out of buffer read when code assumes that\n> pointer points to a full buffer size worth of memory to use.\n>\n> This could potentially lead to information leakage but most likely a\n> crash/denial of service for applications if a server triggers this\n> flaw.\n>\n> We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.\n",

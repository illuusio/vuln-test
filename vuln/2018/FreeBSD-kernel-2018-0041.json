There is a segmentation fault, associated with a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service in the intuit\\_diff\\_type function in pch.c, aka a \"mangled rename\" issue.\n\n> A double free exists in the another\\_hunk function in pch.c in GNU patch through 2.7.6.\n\n> GNU Patch version 2.7.6 contains an input validation vulnerability when processing patch files, specifically the EDITOR\\_PROGRAM invocation (using ed) can result in code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via a patch file processed via the patch utility. This is similar to FreeBSD's CVE-2015-1418 however although they share a common ancestry the code bases have diverged over time.",

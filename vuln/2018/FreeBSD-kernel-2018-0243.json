One of the configurable\n> parameters in algorithm identifier structures for RSASSA-PSS signatures is the\n> mask generation function (MGF). Only MGF1 is currently specified for this\n> purpose. However, this in turn takes itself a parameter that specifies the\n> underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did not correctly handle the\n> case of this parameter being absent, causing an undefined data read.\n> his vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-6459.",

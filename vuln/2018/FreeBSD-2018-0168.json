In standard TYPO3 core distributions stored\n> passwords using the blowfish hashing algorithm can be overridden when\n> using MD5 as the default hashing algorithm by just knowing a valid\n> username. Per default the Portable PHP hashing algorithm (PHPass) is\n> used which is not vulnerable.\n>\n> Phar files (formerly known as \\\"PHP archives\\\") can act als self\n> extracting archives which leads to the fact that source code is\n> executed when Phar files are invoked. The Phar file format is not\n> limited to be stored with a dedicated file extension - \\\"bundle.phar\\\"\n> would be valid as well as \\\"bundle.txt\\\" would be. This way, Phar\n> files can be obfuscated as image or text file which would not be\n> denied from being uploaded and persisted to a TYPO3 installation. Due\n> to a missing sanitization of user input, those Phar files can be\n> invoked by manipulated URLs in TYPO3 backend forms. A valid backend\n> user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. In theory the\n> attack vector would be possible in the TYPO3 frontend as well, however\n> no functional exploit has been identified so far.\n>\n> Failing to properly dissociate system related configuration from user\n> generated configuration, the Form Framework (system extension\n> \\\"form\\\") is vulnerable to SQL injection and Privilege Escalation.\n> Basically instructions can be persisted to a form definition file that\n> were not configured to be modified - this applies to definitions\n> managed using the form editor module as well as direct file upload\n> using the regular file list module. A valid backend user account as\n> well as having system extension form activated are needed in order to\n> exploit this vulnerability.\n>\n> It has been discovered that the Form Framework (system extension\n> \\\"form\\\") is vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization when being used\n> with the additional PHP PECL package \"yaml\", which is capable of\n> unserializing YAML contents to PHP objects.

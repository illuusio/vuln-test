As with the previous issue, this flaw allows for changes\n> to an XML document that do not break a digital signature but can alter\n> the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and result\n> in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected information.\n>\n> As before, the use of XML Encryption is a significant mitigation, but\n> we have not dismissed the possibility that attacks on the Response\n> \\\"envelope\\\" may be possible, in both the original and this new case.\n> No actual attacks of this nature are known, so deployers should\n> prioritize patching systems that expect to handle unencrypted SAML\n> assertions.\n>\n> An updated version of XMLTooling-C (V1.6.4) is available that protects\n> against these new attacks, and should help prevent similar\n> vulnerabilities in the future.\n>\n> Unlike the previous case, these bugs are NOT prevented by any existing\n> Xerces-C parser version on any platform and cannot be addressed by any\n> means other than the updated XMLTooling-C library.\n>\n> The Service Provider software relies on a generic XML parser to\n> process SAML responses and there are limitations in older versions of\n> the parser that make it impossible to fully disable Document Type\n> Definition (DTD) processing.\n>\n> Through addition/manipulation of a DTD, it\\'s possible to make changes\n> to an XML document that do not break a digital signature but are\n> mishandled by the SP and its libraries. These manipulations can alter\n> the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and result\n> in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected information.\n>\n> While newer versions of the xerces-c3 parser are configured by the SP\n> into disallowing the use of a DTD via an environment variable, this\n> feature is not present in the xerces-c3 parser before version 3.1.4,\n> so an additional fix is being provided now that an actual DTD exploit\n> has been identified. Xerces-c3-3.1.4 was committed to the ports tree\n> already on 2016-07-26.\n",

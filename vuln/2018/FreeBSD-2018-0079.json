Two of these, known as Meltdown\nand Spectre V2, are addressed here.\n\nCVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown) -\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\n\nThis issue relies on an affected CPU speculatively executing\ninstructions beyond a faulting instruction. When this happens, changes\nto architectural state are not committed, but observable changes may be\nleft in micro- architectural state (for example, cache). This may be\nused to infer privileged data.\n\nCVE-2017-5715 (Spectre V2) -\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\n\nSpectre V2 uses branch target injection to speculatively execute kernel\ncode at an address under the control of an attacker.\n\n# Impact:\n\nAn attacker may be able to read secret data from the kernel or from a\nprocess when executing untrusted code (for example, in a web browser).\n",

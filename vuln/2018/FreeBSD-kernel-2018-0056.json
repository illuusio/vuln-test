Some two instances of OpenSSL::X509::Name are equal only when\n> all entities are exactly equal. However, there is a bug that the\n> equality check is not correct if the value of an entity of the\n> argument (right-hand side) starts with the value of the receiver\n> (left-hand side). So, if a malicious X.509 certificate is passed to\n> compare with an existing certificate, there is a possibility to be\n> judged incorrectly that they are equal.\n>\n> CVE-2018-16396: Tainted flags are not propagated in Array#pack and\n> String#unpack with some directives\n>\n> Array#pack method converts the receiver's contents into a string with\n> specified format. If the receiver contains some tainted objects, the\n> returned string also should be tainted. String#unpack method which\n> converts the receiver into an array also should propagate its tainted\n> flag to the objects contained in the returned array. But, with B, b, H\n> and h directives, the tainted flags are not propagated. So, if a script\n> processes unreliable inputs by Array#pack and/or String#unpack with\n> these directives and checks the reliability with tainted flags, the\n> check might be wrong.",

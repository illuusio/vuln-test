Subsequent formulas can operate on\n> that inserted data and construct a remote URL whose path leaks the local\n> data to a remote attacker.\n>\n> In later versions of LibreOffice without this flaw, WEBSERVICE has now\n> been limited to accessing http and https URLs along with bringing\n> WEBSERVICE URLs under LibreOffice Calc's link management infrastructure.\n>\n> **Note:** This vulnerability has been identified upstream\n> as CVE-2018-1055, but NVD/Mitre are advising it's a reservation\n> duplicate of CVE-2018-6871 which should be used instead.",

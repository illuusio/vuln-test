    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nA researcher has notified us of a DoS attack applicable\nto another operating system. While FreeBSD may not be\nvulnerable to that exact attack, we have identified several\nplaces where inadequate DoS protection could allow an\nattacker to consume system resources.\n\nIt is not necessary that the attacker be able to establish\ntwo-way communication to carry out these attacks. These\nattacks impact both IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIn the worst case, an attacker could send a stream of\ncrafted fragments with a low packet rate which would consume\na substantial amount of CPU.\n\nOther attack vectors allow an attacker to send a stream\nof crafted fragments which could consume a large amount of\nCPU or all available mbuf clusters on the system.\n\nThese attacks could temporarily render a system unreachable\nthrough network interfaces or temporarily render a system\nunresponsive. The effects of the attack should clear within\n60 seconds after the attack stops.",

This can cause carefully crafted emails that might\n> take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial of Service.\n>\n> Fix a reliance on \\\".\\\" in \\@INC in one configuration script. Whether\n> this can be exploited in any way is uncertain.\n>\n> Fix a potential Remote Code Execution bug with the PDFInfo plugin.\n> Thanks to cPanel Security Team for their report of this issue.\n>\n> Fourth, this release fixes a local user code injection in the meta\n> rule syntax.

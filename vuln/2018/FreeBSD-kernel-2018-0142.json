    "details": "Typo3 core team reports:\n\n> It has been discovered that TYPO3\u2019s Salted Password system extension (which is a mandatory system component)\n> is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass when using hashing methods which are related by PHP class inheritance.\n> In standard TYPO3 core distributions stored passwords using the blowfish hashing algorithm can be overridden\n> when using MD5 as the default hashing algorithm by just knowing a valid username.\n> Per default the Portable PHP hashing algorithm (PHPass) is used which is not vulnerable.\n>\n> Phar files (formerly known as \"PHP archives\") can act als self extracting archives which leads to the fact\n> that source code is executed when Phar files are invoked. The Phar file format is not limited to be stored\n> with a dedicated file extension - \"bundle.phar\" would be valid as well as \"bundle.txt\" would be. This way,\n> Phar files can be obfuscated as image or text file which would not be denied from being uploaded and persisted\n> to a TYPO3 installation. Due to a missing sanitization of user input, those Phar files can be invoked by\n> manipulated URLs in TYPO3 backend forms. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n> In theory the attack vector would be possible in the TYPO3 frontend as well, however no functional exploit\n> has been identified so far.\n>\n> Failing to properly dissociate system related configuration from user generated configuration,\n> the Form Framework (system extension \"form\") is vulnerable to SQL injection and Privilege Escalation.\n> Basically instructions can be persisted to a form definition file that were not configured to be modified -\n> this applies to definitions managed using the form editor module as well as direct file upload using the regular\n> file list module. A valid backend user account as well as having system extension form activated are needed\n> in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n>\n> It has been discovered that the Form Framework (system extension \"form\") is vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization\n> when being used with the additional PHP PECL package \u201cyaml\u201d, which is capable of unserializing YAML contents\n> to PHP objects. A valid backend user account as well as having PHP setting \"yaml.decode\\_php\" enabled is needed\n> to exploit this vulnerability.",

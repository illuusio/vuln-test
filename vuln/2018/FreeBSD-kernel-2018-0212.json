So, if a script accepts an\n> external input as the prefix, and the targeted directory has\n> inappropriate permissions or the ruby process has inappropriate\n> privileges, the attacker can create a directory or a file at any\n> directory.\n>\n> CVE-2018-8777: DoS by large request in WEBrick\n>\n> If an attacker sends a large request which contains huge HTTP headers,\n> WEBrick try to process it on memory, so the request causes the\n> out-of-memory DoS attack.\n>\n> CVE-2018-8778: Buffer under-read in String#unpack\n>\n> String#unpack receives format specifiers as its parameter, and can\n> be specified the position of parsing the data by the specifier @. If a\n> big number is passed with @, the number is treated as the negative\n> value, and out-of-buffer read is occurred. So, if a script accepts an\n> external input as the argument of String#unpack, the attacker can read\n> data on heaps.\n>\n> CVE-2018-8779: Unintentional socket creation by poisoned NUL byte in\n> UNIXServer and UNIXSocket\n>\n> UNIXServer.open accepts the path of the socket to be created at the\n> first parameter. If the path contains NUL (\\0) bytes, this method\n> recognize that the path is completed before the NUL bytes. So, if a\n> script accepts an external input as the argument of this method, the\n> attacker can make the socket file in the unintentional path. And,\n> UNIXSocket.open also accepts the path of the socket to be created at\n> the first parameter without checking NUL bytes like UNIXServer.open.\n> So, if a script accepts an external input as the argument of this\n> method, the attacker can accepts the socket file in the unintentional\n> path.\n>\n> CVE-2018-8780: Unintentional directory traversal by poisoned NUL byte\n> in Dir\n>\n> Dir.open, Dir.new, Dir.entries and Dir.empty? accept the path of the\n> target directory as their parameter.

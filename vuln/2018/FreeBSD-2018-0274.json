The issue is due to the fact that some\n> memory is allocated before the parsing and is not always properly\n> released if the record is malformed. When the PowerDNS Recursor is run\n> inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd, an out-of-memory\n> crash will lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to a\n> somewhat degraded service.\n>\n> CVE-2018-14626: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor allowing\n> a remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an answer without\n> DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache and be returned to\n> clients asking for DNSSEC records, thus hiding the presence of DNSSEC\n> signatures for a specific qname and qtype. For a DNSSEC-signed domain,\n> this means that clients performing DNSSEC validation by themselves\n> might consider the answer to be bogus until it expires from the packet\n> cache, leading to a denial of service.\n>\n> CVE-2018-14644: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where a\n> remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead\n> to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only\n> arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers\n> for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one\n> of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients\n> requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.\n",

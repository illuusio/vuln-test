Sending the same set of headers\n> to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that\n> pass on custom \\`Authorization:\\` headers, as this header often\n> contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others\n> to impersonate the libcurl-using client\\'s request.\n",

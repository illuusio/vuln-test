A valid backend user\n> account or write access on the server system (e.g. SFTP) is needed in order to exploit this\n> vulnerability.\n>\n> Failing to properly encode user input, notifications shown in modal windows in the TYPO3\n> backend are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. A valid backend user account is needed in\n> order to exploit this vulnerability.\n>\n> Failing to properly encode user input, login status display is vulnerable to cross-site\n> scripting in the website frontend. A valid user account is needed in order to exploit this\n> vulnerability - either a backend user or a frontend user having the possibility to modify\n> their user profile.\n>\n> Template patterns that are affected are:\n>\n> * ###FEUSER\\_[fieldName]### using system extension felogin\n> * <!--###USERNAME###--> for regular frontend rendering\n>   (pattern can be defined individually using TypoScript setting\n>   config.USERNAME\\_substToken)\n>\n> It has been discovered that cookies created in the Install Tool are not hardened to be\n> submitted only via HTTP. In combination with other vulnerabilities such as cross-site\n> scripting it can lead to hijacking an active and valid session in the Install Tool.\n>\n> The Install Tool exposes the current TYPO3 version number to non-authenticated users.\n>\n> Online Media Asset Handling (\\*.youtube and \\*.vimeo files) in the TYPO3 backend is vulnerable\n> to denial of service. Putting large files with according file extensions results in high\n> consumption of system resources. This can lead to exceeding limits of the current PHP process\n> which results in a dysfunctional backend component.

    "details": "The Django Project reports:\n\n> 1.  Host header poisoning\n>\n>     Several earlier Django security releases focused on the issue of\n>     poisoning the HTTP Host header, causing Django to generate URLs\n>     pointing to arbitrary, potentially-malicious domains.\n>\n>     In response to further input received and reports of continuing\n>     issues following the previous release, we\\'re taking additional\n>     steps to tighten Host header validation. Rather than attempt to\n>     accommodate all features HTTP supports here, Django\\'s Host header\n>     validation attempts to support a smaller, but far more common,\n>     subset:\n>\n>     - Hostnames must consist of characters \\[A-Za-z0-9\\] plus hyphen\n>       (\\'-\\') or dot (\\'.\\').\n>     - IP addresses \\-- both IPv4 and IPv6 \\-- are permitted.\n>     - Port, if specified, is numeric.\n>\n>     Any deviation from this will now be rejected, raising the\n>     exception django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation.\n>\n> 2.  Redirect poisoning\n>\n>     Also following up on a previous issue: in July of this year, we\n>     made changes to Django\\'s HTTP redirect classes, performing\n>     additional validation of the scheme of the URL to redirect to\n>     (since, both within Django\\'s own supplied applications and many\n>     third-party applications, accepting a user-supplied redirect\n>     target is a common pattern).\n>\n>     Since then, two independent audits of the code turned up further\n>     potential problems. So, similar to the Host-header issue, we are\n>     taking steps to provide tighter validation in response to reported\n>     problems (primarily with third-party applications, but to a\n>     certain extent also within Django itself). This comes in two\n>     parts:\n>\n>     1.  A new utility function, django.utils.http.is_safe_url, is\n>         added; this function takes a URL and a hostname, and checks\n>         that the URL is either relative, or if absolute matches the\n>         supplied hostname. This function is intended for use whenever\n>         user-supplied redirect targets are accepted, to ensure that\n>         such redirects cannot lead to arbitrary third-party sites.\n>     2.  All of Django\\'s own built-in views \\-- primarily in the\n>         authentication system \\-- which allow user-supplied redirect\n>         targets now use is_safe_url to validate the supplied URL.\n",

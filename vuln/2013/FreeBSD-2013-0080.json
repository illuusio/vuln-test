SECURITY-63 / CVE-2013-2034\n>\n>     This creates a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on\n>     Jenkins master, where an anonymous attacker can trick an\n>     administrator to execute arbitrary code on Jenkins master by\n>     having him open a specifically crafted attack URL.\n>\n>     There\\'s also a related vulnerability where the permission check\n>     on this ability is done imprecisely, which may affect those who\n>     are running Jenkins instances with a custom authorization strategy\n>     plugin.\n>\n> 2.  SECURITY-67 / CVE-2013-2033\n>\n>     This creates a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where an\n>     attacker with a valid user account on Jenkins can execute\n>     JavaScript in the browser of other users, if those users are using\n>     certain browsers.\n>\n> 3.  SECURITY-69 / CVE-2013-2034\n>\n>     This is another CSRF vulnerability that allows an attacker to\n>     cause a deployment of binaries to Maven repositories. This\n>     vulnerability has the same CVE ID as SEUCRITY-63.\n>\n> 4.  SECURITY-71 / CVE-2013-1808\n>\n>     This creates a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n",

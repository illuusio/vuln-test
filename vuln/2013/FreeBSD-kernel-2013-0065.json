Thus a user that was\n> allowed to use the SetEnv directive in a .htaccess file (AllowOverride\n> FileInfo) could make PHP load a malicious configuration file (e.g.\n> loading malicious extensions).\n>\n> As the PHP process for highlighting the source file was run with the\n> privileges of the user Apache HTTPd was running as, a local attacker\n> could probably execute arbitrary code with the privileges of this user.",

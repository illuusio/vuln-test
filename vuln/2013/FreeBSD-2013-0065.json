Anyone with access to the port the\n> PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request. This issue was\n> discovered by Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source\n> Software Center.\n>\n> Two lesser security fixes are also included in this release:\n> \\[CVE-2013-1900\\](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1900),\n> wherein random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be\n> easy for another database user to guess (all versions), and\n> \\[CVE-2013-1901\\](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1901),\n> which mistakenly allows an unprivileged user to run commands that\n> could interfere with in-progress backups (for versions 9.x only).\n",

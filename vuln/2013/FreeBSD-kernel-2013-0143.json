    "details": "Moses Mendoza reports:\n\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client\n> to cause the master to execute arbitrary code while responding to a\n> catalog request. Specifically, in order to exploit the\n> vulnerability, the puppet master must be made to invoke the\n> 'template' or 'inline\\_template' functions during catalog compilation.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client\n> to connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions.\n> Specifically, given a valid certificate and private key, an agent\n> could retrieve catalogs from the master that it is not authorized\n> to access or it could poison the puppet master's caches for any\n> puppet-generated data that supports caching such as catalogs,\n> nodes, facts, and resources. The extent and severity of this\n> vulnerability varies depending on the specific configuration of the\n> master: for example, whether it is using storeconfigs or not, which\n> version, whether it has access to the cache or not, etc.\n>\n> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet which could allow\n> authenticated clients to execute arbitrary code on agents that have\n> been configured to accept kick connections. This vulnerability is\n> not present in the default configuration of puppet agents, but if\n> they have been configured to listen for incoming connections\n> ('listen=true'), and the agent's auth.conf has been configured to\n> allow access to the `run` REST endpoint, then a client could\n> construct an HTTP request which could execute arbitrary code. The\n> severity of this issue is exacerbated by the fact that puppet\n> agents typically run as root.\n>\n> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client\n> negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master's\n> SSL protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain\n> design weaknesses. This issue only affects systems running older\n> versions (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer versions explicitly disable\n> SSLv2.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow unauthenticated clients\n> to send requests to the puppet master which would cause it to load\n> code unsafely. While there are no reported exploits, this\n> vulnerability could cause issues like those described in Rails\n> CVE-2013-0156. This vulnerability only affects puppet masters\n> running Ruby 1.9.3 and higher.\n>\n> This vulnerability affects puppet masters 0.25.0 and above. By\n> default, auth.conf allows any authenticated node to submit a report\n> for any other node. This can cause issues with compliance. The\n> defaults in auth.conf have been changed.",

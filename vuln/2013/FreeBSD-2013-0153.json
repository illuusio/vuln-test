It is therefore possible to create a hardlink from a\nlocation in one nullfs instance to a file in another, as long as the\nunderlying (source) filesystem is the same.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf multiple nullfs views into the same filesystem are mounted in\ndifferent locations, a user with read access to one of these views and\nwrite access to another will be able to create a hard link from the\nlatter to a file in the former, even though they are, from the user\\'s\nperspective, different filesystems. The user may thereby gain write\naccess to files which are nominally on a read-only filesystem.\n",

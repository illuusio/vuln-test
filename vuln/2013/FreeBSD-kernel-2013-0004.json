    "details": "Werner Koch reports:\n\n> CVE-2013-4576 has been assigned to this security bug.\n>\n> The paper describes two attacks. The first attack allows\n> to distinguish keys: An attacker is able to notice which key is\n> currently used for decryption. This is in general not a problem but\n> may be used to reveal the information that a message, encrypted to a\n> commonly not used key, has been received by the targeted machine. We\n> do not have a software solution to mitigate this attack.\n>\n> The second attack is more serious. It is an adaptive\n> chosen ciphertext attack to reveal the private key. A possible\n> scenario is that the attacker places a sensor (for example a standard\n> smartphone) in the vicinity of the targeted machine. That machine is\n> assumed to do unattended RSA decryption of received mails, for example\n> by using a mail client which speeds up browsing by opportunistically\n> decrypting mails expected to be read soon. While listening to the\n> acoustic emanations of the targeted machine, the smartphone will send\n> new encrypted messages to that machine and re-construct the private\n> key bit by bit. A 4096 bit RSA key used on a laptop can be revealed\n> within an hour.",

Remote Heap Overflow: If an attacker sends a\n> packet larger than 1024 bytes that gets stored temporarily (which\n> occurs many times - such as when sending a ZRTP Hello packet), a\n> heap overflow will occur, leading to potential arbitrary code\n> execution on the vulnerable host.\n>\n> Vulnerability 2. Multiple Stack Overflows: ZRTPCPP contains\n> multiple stack overflows that arise when preparing a response\n> to a client's ZRTP Hello packet.\n>\n> Vulnerability 3. Information Leaking / Out of Bounds Reads:\n> The ZRTPCPP library performs very little validation regarding the\n> expected size of a packet versus the actual amount of data\n> received. This can lead to both information leaking and out\n> of bounds data reads (usually resulting in a crash).\n> Information leaking can be performed for example by sending\n> a malformed ZRTP Ping packet.",

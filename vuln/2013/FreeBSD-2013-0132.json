In this paper we demonstrate how to use the\n> attack to extract private encryption keys from GnuPG. The high\n> resolution and low noise of the Flush+Reload attack enables a spy\n> program to recover over 98% of the bits of the private key in a single\n> decryption or signing round. Unlike previous attacks, the attack\n> targets the last level L3 cache. Consequently, the spy program and the\n> victim do not need to share the execution core of the CPU. The attack\n> is not limited to a traditional OS and can be used in a virtualised\n> environment, where it can attack programs executing in a different VM.\n",

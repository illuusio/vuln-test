    "details": "Thomas Sibley reports:\n\n> We discovered a number of security vulnerabilities which affect both\n> RT 3.8.x and RT 4.0.x. We are releasing RT versions 3.8.17 and 4.0.13\n> to resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop\n> all released versions of 3.8 and 4.0.\n>\n> The vulnerabilities addressed by 3.8.17, 4.0.13, and the below patches\n> include the following:\n>\n> RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to a limited privilege escalation\n> leading to unauthorized modification of ticket data. The DeleteTicket\n> right and any custom lifecycle transition rights may be bypassed by\n> any user with ModifyTicket. This vulnerability is assigned\n> CVE-2012-4733.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above include a version of bin/rt that uses\n> semi-predictable names when creating tempfiles. This could possibly be\n> exploited by a malicious user to overwrite files with permissions of\n> the user running bin/rt. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3368.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above allow calling of arbitrary Mason components\n> (without control of arguments) for users who can see administration\n> pages. This could be used by a malicious user to run private\n> components which may have negative side-effects. This vulnerability is\n> assigned CVE-2013-3369.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above allow direct requests to private callback\n> components. Though no callback components ship with RT, this could be\n> used to exploit an extension or local callback which uses the\n> arguments passed to it insecurely. This vulnerability is assigned\n> CVE-2013-3370.\n>\n> RT 3.8.3 and above are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via\n> attachment filenames. The vector is difficult to exploit due to\n> parsing requirements. Additionally, RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable\n> to XSS via maliciously-crafted \\\"URLs\\\" in ticket content when RT\\'s\n> \\\"MakeClicky\\\" feature is configured. Although not believed to be\n> exploitable in the stock configuration, a patch is also included for\n> RTIR 2.6.x to add bulletproofing. These vulnerabilities are assigned\n> CVE-2013-3371.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to an HTTP header injection limited\n> to the value of the Content-Disposition header. Injection of other\n> arbitrary response headers is not possible. Some (especially older)\n> browsers may allow multiple Content-Disposition values which could\n> lead to XSS. Newer browsers contain security measures to prevent this.\n> Thank you to Dominic Hargreaves for reporting this vulnerability. This\n> vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3372.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to a MIME header injection in\n> outgoing email generated by RT. The vectors via RT\\'s stock templates\n> are resolved by this patchset, but any custom email templates should\n> be updated to ensure that values interpolated into mail headers do not\n> contain newlines. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3373.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to limited session re-use when using\n> the file-based session store, Apache::Session::File. RT\\'s default\n> session configuration only uses Apache::Session::File for Oracle. RT\n> instances using Oracle may be locally configured to use the\n> database-backed Apache::Session::Oracle, in which case sessions are\n> never re-used. The extent of session re-use is limited to information\n> leaks of certain user preferences and caches, such as queue names\n> available for ticket creation. Thank you to Jenny Martin for reporting\n> the problem that lead to discovery of this vulnerability. This\n> vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3374.\n",

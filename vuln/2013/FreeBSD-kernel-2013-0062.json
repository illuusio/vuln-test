In this paper we demonstrate how to use the\n> attack to extract private encryption keys from GnuPG. The high\n> resolution and low noise of the Flush+Reload attack enables a spy\n> program to recover over 98% of the bits of the private key in a\n> single decryption or signing round. Unlike previous attacks, the\n> attack targets the last level L3 cache. Consequently, the spy\n> program and the victim do not need to share the execution core of\n> the CPU. The attack is not limited to a traditional OS and can be\n> used in a virtualised environment, where it can attack programs\n> executing in a different VM.",

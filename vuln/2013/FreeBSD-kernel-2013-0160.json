    "details": "The Django Project reports:\n\n> These security releases fix four issues: one potential phishing\n> vector, one denial-of-service vector, an information leakage issue,\n> and a range of XML vulnerabilities.\n>\n> 1. Host header poisoning\n>\n>    an attacker could cause Django to generate and display URLs that\n>    link to arbitrary domains. This could be used as part of a phishing\n>    attack. These releases fix this problem by introducing a new\n>    setting, ALLOWED\\_HOSTS, which specifies a whitelist of domains your\n>    site is known to respond to.\n>\n>    Important: by default Django 1.3.6 and 1.4.4 set ALLOWED\\_HOSTS to\n>    allow all hosts. This means that to actually fix the security\n>    vulnerability you should define this setting yourself immediately\n>    after upgrading.\n> 2. Formset denial-of-service\n>\n>    an attacker can abuse Django's tracking of the number of forms in\n>    a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack. This has been fixed\n>    by adding a default maximum number of forms of 1,000. You can still\n>    manually specify a bigger max\\_num, if you wish, but 1,000 should be\n>    enough for anyone.\n> 3. XML attacks\n>\n>    Django's serialization framework was vulnerable to attacks via XML\n>    entity expansion and external references; this is now fixed.\n>    However, if you're parsing arbitrary XML in other parts of your\n>    application, we recommend you look into the defusedxml Python\n>    packages which remedy this anywhere you parse XML, not just via\n>    Django's serialization framework.\n> 4. Data leakage via admin history log\n>\n>    Django's admin interface could expose supposedly-hidden\n>    information via its history log. This has been fixed.",

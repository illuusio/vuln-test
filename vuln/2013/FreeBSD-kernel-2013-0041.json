It is\ntherefore possible to create a hardlink from a location in\none nullfs instance to a file in another, as long as the\nunderlying (source) filesystem is the same.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf multiple nullfs views into the same filesystem are\nmounted in different locations, a user with read access to\none of these views and write access to another will be able\nto create a hard link from the latter to a file in the\nformer, even though they are, from the user's perspective,\ndifferent filesystems. The user may thereby gain write\naccess to files which are nominally on a read-only\nfilesystem.",

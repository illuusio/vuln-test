The first attack allows to\n> distinguish keys: An attacker is able to notice which key is currently\n> used for decryption. This is in general not a problem but may be used\n> to reveal the information that a message, encrypted to a commonly not\n> used key, has been received by the targeted machine. We do not have a\n> software solution to mitigate this attack.\n>\n> The second attack is more serious. It is an adaptive chosen ciphertext\n> attack to reveal the private key. A possible scenario is that the\n> attacker places a sensor (for example a standard smartphone) in the\n> vicinity of the targeted machine. That machine is assumed to do\n> unattended RSA decryption of received mails, for example by using a\n> mail client which speeds up browsing by opportunistically decrypting\n> mails expected to be read soon. While listening to the acoustic\n> emanations of the targeted machine, the smartphone will send new\n> encrypted messages to that machine and re-construct the private key\n> bit by bit. A 4096 bit RSA key used on a laptop can be revealed within\n> an hour.\n",

As the RFC specifies that the certificates in the\n> Certificate message are always X.509 certificates in DER format,\n> bugs in the decoding of PEM certificates should normally not be\n> triggerable via the SSL/TLS handshake.\n>\n> Versions of PolarSSL prior to 1.1.7 in the 1.1 branch and prior\n> to 1.2.8 in the 1.2 branch call the generic x509parse\\_crt()\n> function for parsing during the handshake. x509parse\\_crt() is a\n> generic functions that wraps parsing of both PEM-encoded and\n> DER-formatted certificates. As a result it is possible to craft\n> a Certificate message that includes a PEM encoded certificate in\n> the Certificate message that triggers the infinite loop.",

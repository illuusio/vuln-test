All users of the affected versions are strongly urged to apply\n> the update \\*immediately\\*.\n>\n> A major security issue (for versions 9.x only) fixed in this release,\n> [CVE-2013-1899](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1899),\n> makes it possible for a connection request containing a database name\n> that begins with \"-\" to be crafted that can damage or destroy files\n> within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the port the\n> PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request. This issue was\n> discovered by Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source\n> Software Center.\n>\n> Two lesser security fixes are also included in this release:\n> [CVE-2013-1900](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1900),\n> wherein random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be\n> easy for another database user to guess (all versions), and\n> [CVE-2013-1901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1901),\n> which mistakenly allows an unprivileged user to run commands that\n> could interfere with in-progress backups (for versions 9.x only).",

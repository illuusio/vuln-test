SECURITY-63 / CVE-2013-2034\n>\n>    This creates a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\n>    on Jenkins master, where an anonymous attacker can trick an\n>    administrator to execute arbitrary code on Jenkins master by\n>    having him open a specifically crafted attack URL.\n>\n>    There's also a related vulnerability where the permission\n>    check on this ability is done imprecisely, which may affect\n>    those who are running Jenkins instances with a custom\n>    authorization strategy plugin.\n> 2. SECURITY-67 / CVE-2013-2033\n>\n>    This creates a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where\n>    an attacker with a valid user account on Jenkins can execute\n>    JavaScript in the browser of other users, if those users are\n>    using certain browsers.\n> 3. SECURITY-69 / CVE-2013-2034\n>\n>    This is another CSRF vulnerability that allows an attacker to\n>    cause a deployment of binaries to Maven repositories. This\n>    vulnerability has the same CVE ID as SEUCRITY-63.\n> 4. SECURITY-71 / CVE-2013-1808\n>\n>    This creates a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",

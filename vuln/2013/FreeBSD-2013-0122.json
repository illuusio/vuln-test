Remote Heap Overflow: If an attacker sends a packet\n> larger than 1024 bytes that gets stored temporarily (which occurs many\n> times - such as when sending a ZRTP Hello packet), a heap overflow\n> will occur, leading to potential arbitrary code execution on the\n> vulnerable host.\n>\n> Vulnerability 2. Multiple Stack Overflows: ZRTPCPP contains multiple\n> stack overflows that arise when preparing a response to a client\\'s\n> ZRTP Hello packet.\n>\n> Vulnerability 3. Information Leaking / Out of Bounds Reads: The\n> ZRTPCPP library performs very little validation regarding the expected\n> size of a packet versus the actual amount of data received. This can\n> lead to both information leaking and out of bounds data reads (usually\n> resulting in a crash). Information leaking can be performed for\n> example by sending a malformed ZRTP Ping packet.\n",

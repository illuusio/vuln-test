URL-encoded octets are represented with %HH combinations\n> where HH is a two-digit hexadecimal number. The decoded string is\n> written to an allocated memory area that the function returns to the\n> caller.\n>\n> The function takes a source string and a length parameter, and if the\n> length provided is 0 the function will instead use strlen() to figure\n> out how much data to parse.\n>\n> The \\\"%HH\\\" parser wrongly only considered the case where a zero byte\n> would terminate the input. If a length-limited buffer was passed in\n> which ended with a \\'%\\' character which was followed by two\n> hexadecimal digits outside of the buffer libcurl was allowed to parse\n> alas without a terminating zero, libcurl would still parse that\n> sequence as well. The counter for remaining data to handle would then\n> be decreased too much and wrap to become a very large integer and the\n> copying would go on too long and the destination buffer that is\n> allocated on the heap would get overwritten.\n>\n> We consider it unlikely that programs allow user-provided strings\n> unfiltered into this function. Also, only the not zero-terminated\n> input string use case is affected by this flaw. Exploiting this flaw\n> for gain is probably possible for specific circumstances but we\n> consider the general risk for this to be low.\n>\n> The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it\n> doesn\\'t use this function.\n>\n> There are no known exploits available at this time.\n",

One of the vulnerabilities allows cross-site request\n>    forgery (CSRF) attacks on Jenkins master, which causes an user\n>    to make unwanted actions on Jenkins. Another vulnerability\n>    enables cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which has the similar\n>    consequence. Another vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass\n>    the CSRF protection mechanism in place, thereby mounting more CSRF\n>    attackes. These attacks allow an attacker without direct access to\n>    Jenkins to mount an attack.\n> 2. In the fourth vulnerability, a malicious user of Jenkins can trick\n>    Jenkins into building jobs that he does not have direct access to.\n> 3. And lastly, a vulnerability allows a malicious user of Jenkins to\n>    mount a denial of service attack by feeding a carefully crafted\n>    payload to Jenkins.",

    "details": "Moses Mendoza reports:\n\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client\n> to cause the master to execute arbitrary code while responding to a\n> catalog request. Specifically, in order to exploit the\n> vulnerability, the puppet master must be made to invoke the\n> 'template' or 'inline\\_template' functions during catalog compilation.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client\n> to connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions.\n> Specifically, given a valid certificate and private key, an agent\n> could retrieve catalogs from the master that it is not authorized\n> to access or it could poison the puppet master's caches for any\n> puppet-generated data that supports caching such as catalogs,\n> nodes, facts, and resources. The extent and severity of this\n> vulnerability varies depending on the specific configuration of the\n> master: for example, whether it is using storeconfigs or not, which\n> version, whether it has access to the cache or not, etc.\n>\n> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client\n> negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master's\n> SSL protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain\n> design weaknesses. This issue only affects systems running older\n> versions (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer versions explicitly disable\n> SSLv2.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client\n> to execute arbitrary code on a puppet master that is running in the\n> default configuration, or an agent with `puppet kick` enabled.\n> Specifically, a properly authenticated and connected puppet agent\n> could be made to construct an HTTP PUT request for an authorized\n> report that actually causes the execution of arbitrary code on the\n> master.\n>\n> This vulnerability affects puppet masters 0.25.0 and above. By\n> default, auth.conf allows any authenticated node to submit a report\n> for any other node. This can cause issues with compliance. The\n> defaults in auth.conf have been changed.",

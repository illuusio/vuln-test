[...]\n>\n> These vulnerabilities can be triggered before host key verification,\n> which means that you are not even safe if you trust the server you\n> *think* you're connecting to, since it could be spoofed over the\n> network and the host key check would not detect this before the attack\n> could take place.\n>\n> Additionally, when PuTTY authenticated with a user's private key, the\n> private key or information equivalent to it was accidentally kept in\n> PuTTY's memory for the rest of its run, where it could be retrieved by\n> other processes reading PuTTY's memory, or written out to swap files\n> or crash dumps. This release fixes that as well.",

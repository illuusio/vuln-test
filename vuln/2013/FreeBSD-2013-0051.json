Specifically, in order to exploit the vulnerability,\n> the puppet master must be made to invoke the \\'template\\' or\n> \\'inline_template\\' functions during catalog compilation.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to\n> connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions.\n> Specifically, given a valid certificate and private key, an agent\n> could retrieve catalogs from the master that it is not authorized to\n> access or it could poison the puppet master\\'s caches for any\n> puppet-generated data that supports caching such as catalogs, nodes,\n> facts, and resources. The extent and severity of this vulnerability\n> varies depending on the specific configuration of the master: for\n> example, whether it is using storeconfigs or not, which version,\n> whether it has access to the cache or not, etc.\n>\n> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet which could allow\n> authenticated clients to execute arbitrary code on agents that have\n> been configured to accept kick connections. This vulnerability is not\n> present in the default configuration of puppet agents, but if they\n> have been configured to listen for incoming connections\n> (\\'listen=true\\'), and the agent\\'s auth.conf has been configured to\n> allow access to the \\`run\\` REST endpoint, then a client could\n> construct an HTTP request which could execute arbitrary code. The\n> severity of this issue is exacerbated by the fact that puppet agents\n> typically run as root.\n>\n> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client\n> negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master\\'s SSL\n> protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain design\n> weaknesses. This issue only affects systems running older versions\n> (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer versions explicitly disable SSLv2.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow unauthenticated clients to\n> send requests to the puppet master which would cause it to load code\n> unsafely. While there are no reported exploits, this vulnerability\n> could cause issues like those described in Rails CVE-2013-0156. This\n> vulnerability only affects puppet masters running Ruby 1.9.3 and\n> higher.\n>\n> This vulnerability affects puppet masters 0.25.0 and above. By\n> default, auth.conf allows any authenticated node to submit a report\n> for any other node. This can cause issues with compliance. The\n> defaults in auth.conf have been changed.\n",

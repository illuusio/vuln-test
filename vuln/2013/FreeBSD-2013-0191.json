CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and\n> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST. The first one tells libcurl to verify the\n> trust chain using a CA cert bundle, while the second tells libcurl to\n> make sure that the name fields in the server certificate meets the\n> criteria. Both options are enabled by default.\n>\n> This flaw had the effect that when an application disabled\n> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, libcurl mistakenly also skipped the\n> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST check. Applications can disable\n> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and still achieve security by doing the check\n> on its own using other means.\n>\n> The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it\n> either enables both options or disables both at the same time.\n",

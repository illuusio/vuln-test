As the RFC specifies that the certificates in the Certificate\n> message are always X.509 certificates in DER format, bugs in the\n> decoding of PEM certificates should normally not be triggerable via\n> the SSL/TLS handshake.\n>\n> Versions of PolarSSL prior to 1.1.7 in the 1.1 branch and prior to\n> 1.2.8 in the 1.2 branch call the generic x509parse_crt() function for\n> parsing during the handshake. x509parse_crt() is a generic functions\n> that wraps parsing of both PEM-encoded and DER-formatted certificates.\n> As a result it is possible to craft a Certificate message that\n> includes a PEM encoded certificate in the Certificate message that\n> triggers the infinite loop.\n",

    "details": "Thomas Sibley reports:\n\n> We discovered a number of security vulnerabilities which\n> affect both RT 3.8.x and RT 4.0.x. We are releasing RT\n> versions 3.8.17 and 4.0.13 to resolve these vulnerabilities,\n> as well as patches which apply atop all released versions of\n> 3.8 and 4.0.\n>\n> The vulnerabilities addressed by 3.8.17, 4.0.13, and the\n> below patches include the following:\n>\n> RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to a limited privilege\n> escalation leading to unauthorized modification of ticket\n> data. The DeleteTicket right and any custom lifecycle\n> transition rights may be bypassed by any user with\n> ModifyTicket. This vulnerability is assigned\n> CVE-2012-4733.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above include a version of bin/rt that uses\n> semi-predictable names when creating tempfiles. This could\n> possibly be exploited by a malicious user to overwrite files\n> with permissions of the user running bin/rt. This\n> vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3368.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above allow calling of arbitrary Mason\n> components (without control of arguments) for users who can\n> see administration pages. This could be used by a malicious\n> user to run private components which may have negative\n> side-effects. This vulnerability is assigned\n> CVE-2013-3369.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above allow direct requests to private\n> callback components. Though no callback components ship\n> with RT, this could be used to exploit an extension or local\n> callback which uses the arguments passed to it insecurely.\n> This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3370.\n>\n> RT 3.8.3 and above are vulnerable to cross-site scripting\n> (XSS) via attachment filenames. The vector is difficult to\n> exploit due to parsing requirements. Additionally, RT 4.0.0\n> and above are vulnerable to XSS via maliciously-crafted\n> \"URLs\" in ticket content when RT's \"MakeClicky\" feature is\n> configured. Although not believed to be exploitable in the\n> stock configuration, a patch is also included for RTIR 2.6.x\n> to add bulletproofing. These vulnerabilities are assigned\n> CVE-2013-3371.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to an HTTP header\n> injection limited to the value of the Content-Disposition\n> header. Injection of other arbitrary response headers is\n> not possible. Some (especially older) browsers may allow\n> multiple Content-Disposition values which could lead to XSS.\n> Newer browsers contain security measures to prevent this.\n> Thank you to Dominic Hargreaves for reporting this\n> vulnerability. This vulnerability is assigned\n> CVE-2013-3372.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to a MIME header\n> injection in outgoing email generated by RT. The vectors\n> via RT's stock templates are resolved by this patchset, but\n> any custom email templates should be updated to ensure that\n> values interpolated into mail headers do not contain\n> newlines. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3373.\n>\n> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to limited session\n> re-use when using the file-based session store,\n> Apache::Session::File. RT's default session configuration\n> only uses Apache::Session::File for Oracle. RT instances\n> using Oracle may be locally configured to use the\n> database-backed Apache::Session::Oracle, in which case\n> sessions are never re-used. The extent of session re-use is\n> limited to information leaks of certain user preferences and\n> caches, such as queue names available for ticket creation.\n> Thank you to Jenny Martin for reporting the problem that\n> lead to discovery of this vulnerability. This vulnerability\n> is assigned CVE-2013-3374.",

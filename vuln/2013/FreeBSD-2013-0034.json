    "details": "The Django Project reports:\n\n> These security releases fix four issues: one potential phishing\n> vector, one denial-of-service vector, an information leakage issue,\n> and a range of XML vulnerabilities.\n>\n> 1.  Host header poisoning\n>\n>     an attacker could cause Django to generate and display URLs that\n>     link to arbitrary domains. This could be used as part of a\n>     phishing attack. These releases fix this problem by introducing a\n>     new setting, ALLOWED_HOSTS, which specifies a whitelist of domains\n>     your site is known to respond to.\n>\n>     Important: by default Django 1.3.6 and 1.4.4 set ALLOWED_HOSTS to\n>     allow all hosts. This means that to actually fix the security\n>     vulnerability you should define this setting yourself immediately\n>     after upgrading.\n>\n> 2.  Formset denial-of-service\n>\n>     an attacker can abuse Django\\'s tracking of the number of forms in\n>     a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack. This has been fixed\n>     by adding a default maximum number of forms of 1,000. You can\n>     still manually specify a bigger max_num, if you wish, but 1,000\n>     should be enough for anyone.\n>\n> 3.  XML attacks\n>\n>     Django\\'s serialization framework was vulnerable to attacks via\n>     XML entity expansion and external references; this is now fixed.\n>     However, if you\\'re parsing arbitrary XML in other parts of your\n>     application, we recommend you look into the defusedxml Python\n>     packages which remedy this anywhere you parse XML, not just via\n>     Django\\'s serialization framework.\n>\n> 4.  Data leakage via admin history log\n>\n>     Django\\'s admin interface could expose supposedly-hidden\n>     information via its history log. This has been fixed.\n",

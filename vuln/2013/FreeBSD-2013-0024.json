One of the vulnerabilities allows cross-site request forgery\n>     (CSRF) attacks on Jenkins master, which causes an user to make\n>     unwanted actions on Jenkins. Another vulnerability enables\n>     cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which has the similar\n>     consequence. Another vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass\n>     the CSRF protection mechanism in place, thereby mounting more CSRF\n>     attackes. These attacks allow an attacker without direct access to\n>     Jenkins to mount an attack.\n> 2.  In the fourth vulnerability, a malicious user of Jenkins can trick\n>     Jenkins into building jobs that he does not have direct access to.\n> 3.  And lastly, a vulnerability allows a malicious user of Jenkins to\n>     mount a denial of service attack by feeding a carefully crafted\n>     payload to Jenkins.\n",

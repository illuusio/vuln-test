    "details": "Moses Mendoza reports:\n\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to\n> cause the master to execute arbitrary code while responding to a\n> catalog request. Specifically, in order to exploit the vulnerability,\n> the puppet master must be made to invoke the \\'template\\' or\n> \\'inline_template\\' functions during catalog compilation.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to\n> connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions.\n> Specifically, given a valid certificate and private key, an agent\n> could retrieve catalogs from the master that it is not authorized to\n> access or it could poison the puppet master\\'s caches for any\n> puppet-generated data that supports caching such as catalogs, nodes,\n> facts, and resources. The extent and severity of this vulnerability\n> varies depending on the specific configuration of the master: for\n> example, whether it is using storeconfigs or not, which version,\n> whether it has access to the cache or not, etc.\n>\n> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client\n> negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master\\'s SSL\n> protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain design\n> weaknesses. This issue only affects systems running older versions\n> (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer versions explicitly disable SSLv2.\n>\n> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to\n> execute arbitrary code on a puppet master that is running in the\n> default configuration, or an agent with \\`puppet kick\\` enabled.\n> Specifically, a properly authenticated and connected puppet agent\n> could be made to construct an HTTP PUT request for an authorized\n> report that actually causes the execution of arbitrary code on the\n> master.\n>\n> This vulnerability affects puppet masters 0.25.0 and above. By\n> default, auth.conf allows any authenticated node to submit a report\n> for any other node. This can cause issues with compliance. The\n> defaults in auth.conf have been changed.\n",

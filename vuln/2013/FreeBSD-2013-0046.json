Credits go to Helmut Hummel\n> and Markus Opahle who discovered and reported the issue.\n>\n> Access tracking mechanism - Failing to validate user provided input,\n> the access tracking mechanism allows redirects to arbitrary URLs. To\n> fix this vulnerability, we had to break existing behaviour of TYPO3\n> sites that use the access tracking mechanism (jumpurl feature) to\n> transform links to external sites. The link generation has been\n> changed to include a hash that is checked before redirecting to an\n> external URL. This means that old links that have been distributed\n> (e.g. by a newsletter) will not work any more.\n",

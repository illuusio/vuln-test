The vulnerability makes it\n> possible for an attacker who has read and write access to the GPU\n> device nodes to reconfigure GPUs to gain access to arbitrary system\n> memory. NVIDIA is not aware of any reports of this vulnerability,\n> outside of the disclosure which was made privately to NVIDIA.\n>\n> NVIDIA has identified the root cause of the vulnerability and has\n> released updated drivers which close it. \\[NVIDIA encourages\\] all\n> users with Geforce 8 or newer, G80 Quadro or newer, and all Tesla GPUs\n> to update their drivers to 295.40 or later.\n\nLater, it was additionally discovered that similar exploit could be\nachieved through remapping of VGA window:\n\n> NVIDIA received notification of a security exploit that uses NVIDIA\n> UNIX device files to map and program registers to redirect the VGA\n> window. Through the VGA window, the exploit can access any region of\n> physical system memory. This arbitrary memory access can be further\n> exploited, for example, to escalate user privileges.\n",

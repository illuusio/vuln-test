A sample exploit for the issue was included\n> in the notification.\n>\n> The vulnerability was created in commit a368a6f4f4aaf on August 18,\n> 2010. Vulnerable versions include 2.1.10, 2.1.11, and 2.1.12. Also\n> anyone running the git \\\"master\\\" branch after August 18, 2010 is\n> vulnerable.\n>\n> All sites using TLS-based EAP methods and the above versions are\n> vulnerable. The only configuration change which can avoid the issue is\n> to disable EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP.\n>\n> An external attacker can use this vulnerability to over-write the\n> stack frame of the RADIUS server, and cause it to crash. In addition,\n> more sophisticated attacks may gain additional privileges on the\n> system running the RADIUS server.\n>\n> This attack does not require local network access to the RADIUS\n> server. It can be done by an attacker through a WiFi Access Point, so\n> long as the Access Point is configured to use 802.1X authentication\n> with the RADIUS server.\n",

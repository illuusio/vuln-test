If a user visits an HTML\n>   page with some malicious JS code in it, an attacker could make\n>   changes to a remote Bugzilla installation on behalf of the victim\\'s\n>   account by using the JSON-RPC API. The user would have had to be\n>   already logged in to the target site for the vulnerability to work.\n>\n> All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as\n> possible.\n",

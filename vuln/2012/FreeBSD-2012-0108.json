This vulnerability therefore impacts upon many\n> public facing MantisBT installations.\n>\n> Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) found that the\n> delete_attachments_threshold permission was not being checked when a\n> user attempted to delete an attachment from an issue. The more generic\n> update_bug_threshold permission was being checked instead. MantisBT\n> administrators may have been under the false impression that their\n> configuration of the delete_attachments_threshold was successfully\n> preventing unwanted users from deleting attachments.\n",

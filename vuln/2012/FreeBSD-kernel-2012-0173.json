Morgan reports:\n\n> In December 2011, VSR identified a vulnerability in multiple open\n> source office products (including OpenOffice, LibreOffice, KOffice,\n> and AbiWord) due to unsafe interpretation of XML files with custom\n> entity declarations. Deeper analysis revealed that the\n> vulnerability was caused by acceptance of external entities by the\n> libraptor library, which is used by librdf and is in turn used by\n> these office products.\n>\n> In the context of office applications, these vulnerabilities could\n> allow for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks resulting in file theft\n> and a loss of user privacy when opening potentially malicious ODF\n> documents. For other applications which depend on librdf or\n> libraptor, potentially serious consequences could result from\n> accepting RDF/XML content from untrusted sources, though the impact\n> may vary widely depending on the context.",

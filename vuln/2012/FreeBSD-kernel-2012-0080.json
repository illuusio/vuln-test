Fixing this required a\n> behavior change: in the past, using rssh without a config\n> file would give all users default access to use scp on an\n> unchrooted system. In order to correct the reported bug,\n> this feature has been eliminated, and you must now have a\n> valid configuration file. If no config file exists, all\n> users will be locked out.",

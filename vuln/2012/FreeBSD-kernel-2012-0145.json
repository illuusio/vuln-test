The vulnerability\n> makes it possible for an attacker who has read and write access\n> to the GPU device nodes to reconfigure GPUs to gain access to\n> arbitrary system memory. NVIDIA is not aware of any reports of\n> this vulnerability, outside of the disclosure which was made\n> privately to NVIDIA.\n>\n> NVIDIA has identified the root cause of the vulnerability and\n> has released updated drivers which close it. [NVIDIA encourages]\n> all users with Geforce 8 or newer, G80 Quadro or newer, and all\n> Tesla GPUs to update their drivers to 295.40 or later.\n\nLater, it was additionally discovered that similar exploit could\nbe achieved through remapping of VGA window:\n\n> NVIDIA received notification of a security exploit that uses\n> NVIDIA UNIX device files to map and program registers to redirect\n> the VGA window. Through the VGA window, the exploit can access\n> any region of physical system memory. This arbitrary memory\n> access can be further exploited, for example, to escalate user\n> privileges.",

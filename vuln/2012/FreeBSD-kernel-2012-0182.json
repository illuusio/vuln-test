    "details": "Michael Gmelin and J\u00f6rg Scheinert has reported a remote\ncommand execution vulnerability in portaudit.\n\nAn attacker who can get the user to use a specially crafted\naudit file will be able to run commands on the users system,\nwith the privileges of the user running running portaudit\n(often root).\n\nThe attack could e.g. happen through DNS hijacking or a man\nin the middle attack.\n\nNote that if the user has set up portaudit to run from\nperiodic this attack could happen without direct user\ninteraction.\n\nIn the FreeBSD Ports Collection (bsd.port.mk) the check for\nvulnerable ports at install-time directly operates on the\nauditfile and has the same vulnerability as portaudit. As\nthe Ports Collection infrastructure does not have a version\nnumber just be sure to have a Ports Collection new enough to\ncontain the fix for portaudit. Note that this is *only*\na problem for users which has portaudit installed, as they will\nnot have the audit database installed or downloaded\notherwise.",

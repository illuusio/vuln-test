    "details": "The Django Project reports:\n\n> 1.  Host header poisoning\n>\n>     Some parts of Django \\-- independent of end-user-written\n>     applications \\-- make use of full URLs, including domain name,\n>     which are generated from the HTTP Host header. Some attacks\n>     against this are beyond Django\\'s ability to control, and require\n>     the web server to be properly configured; Django\\'s documentation\n>     has for some time contained notes advising users on such\n>     configuration.\n>\n>     Django\\'s own built-in parsing of the Host header is, however,\n>     still vulnerable, as was reported to us recently. The Host header\n>     parsing in Django 1.3 and Django 1.4 \\-- specifically,\n>     django.http.HttpRequest.get_host() \\-- was incorrectly handling\n>     username/password information in the header. Thus, for example,\n>     the following Host header would be accepted by Django when running\n>     on \\\"validsite.com\\\":\n>\n>     Host: validsite.com:random@evilsite.com\n>\n>     Using this, an attacker can cause parts of Django \\-- particularly\n>     the password-reset mechanism \\-- to generate and display arbitrary\n>     URLs to users.\n>\n>     To remedy this, the parsing in HttpRequest.get_host() is being\n>     modified; Host headers which contain potentially dangerous content\n>     (such as username/password pairs) now raise the exception\n>     django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation.\n>\n> 2.  Documentation of HttpOnly cookie option\n>\n>     As of Django 1.4, session cookies are always sent with the\n>     HttpOnly flag, which provides some additional protection from\n>     cross-site scripting attacks by denying client-side scripts access\n>     to the session cookie.\n>\n>     Though not directly a security issue in Django, it has been\n>     reported that the Django 1.4 documentation incorrectly described\n>     this change, by claiming that this was now the default for all\n>     cookies set by the HttpResponse.set_cookie() method.\n>\n>     The Django documentation has been updated to reflect that this\n>     only applies to the session cookie. Users of Django are encouraged\n>     to review their use of set_cookie() to ensure that the HttpOnly\n>     flag is being set or unset appropriately.\n",

We are releasing versions 3.8.12 and 4.0.6 to\n> resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop all\n> released versions of 3.8 and 4.0.\n>\n> The vulnerabilities addressed by 3.8.12, 4.0.6, and the below patches\n> include the following:\n>\n> The previously released tool to upgrade weak password hashes as part\n> of CVE-2011-0009 was an incomplete fix and failed to upgrade passwords\n> of disabled users.\n>\n> RT versions 3.0 and above contain a number of cross-site scripting\n> (XSS) vulnerabilities which allow an attacker to run JavaScript with\n> the user\\'s credentials. CVE-2011-2083 is assigned to this\n> vulnerability.\n>\n> RT versions 3.0 and above are vulnerable to multiple information\n> disclosure vulnerabilities. This includes the ability for privileged\n> users to expose users\\' previous password hashes \\-- this\n> vulnerability is particularly dangerous given RT\\'s weak hashing\n> previous to the fix in CVE-2011-0009. A separate vulnerability allows\n> privileged users to obtain correspondence history for any ticket in\n> RT. CVE-2011-2084 is assigned to this vulnerability.\n>\n> All publicly released versions of RT are vulnerable to cross-site\n> request forgery (CSRF). CVE-2011-2085 is assigned to this\n> vulnerability.\n>\n> We have also added a separate configuration option\n> (\\$RestrictLoginReferrer) to prevent login CSRF, a different class of\n> CSRF attack.\n>\n> RT versions 3.6.1 and above are vulnerable to a remote execution of\n> code vulnerability if the optional VERP configuration options\n> (\\$VERPPrefix and \\$VERPDomain) are enabled. RT 3.8.0 and higher are\n> vulnerable to a limited remote execution of code which can be\n> leveraged for privilege escalation. RT 4.0.0 and above contain a\n> vulnerability in the global \\$DisallowExecuteCode option, allowing\n> sufficiently privileged users to still execute code even if RT was\n> configured to not allow it. CVE-2011-4458 is assigned to this set of\n> vulnerabilities.\n>\n> RT versions 3.0 and above may, under some circumstances, still respect\n> rights that a user only has by way of a currently-disabled group.\n> CVE-2011-4459 is assigned to this vulnerability.\n>\n> RT versions 2.0 and above are vulnerable to a SQL injection attack,\n> which allow privileged users to obtain arbitrary information from the\n> database. CVE-2011-4460 is assigned to this vulnerability.\n",

    "details": "Google Reports:\n\n> mod\\_pagespeed 0.10.22.6 is a security update that fixes two\n> critical issues that affect earlier versions:\n>\n> * CVE-2012-4001, a problem with validation of own host name.\n> * CVE-2012-4360, a cross-site scripting attack, which affects versions starting from 0.10.19.1.\n>\n> The effect of the first problem is that it is possible to confuse\n> mod\\_pagespeed about its own host name, and to trick it into\n> fetching resources from other machines. This could be an issue if\n> the HTTP server has access to machines that are not otherwise\n> publicly visible.\n>\n> The second problem would permit a hostile third party to execute\n> JavaScript in users' browsers in context of the domain running\n> mod\\_pagespeed, which could permit interception of users' cookies or\n> data on the site.\n>\n> Because of the severity of the two problems, users are strongly\n> encouraged to update immediately.\n>\n> Behavior Changes in the Update:\n>\n> As part of the fix to the first issue, mod\\_pagespeed will not fetch\n> resources from machines other than localhost if they are not\n> explicitly mentioned in the configuration. This means that if you\n> need resources on the server's domain to be handled by some other\n> system, you'll need to explicitly use ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain\n> or ModPagespeedDomain to authorize that.",

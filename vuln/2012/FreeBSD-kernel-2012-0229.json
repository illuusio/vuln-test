This\n>   text is not correctly escaped and a crafted URL could use\n>   this vulnerability to inject code leading to XSS.\n> * The User.offer\\_account\\_by\\_email WebService method ignores\n>   the user\\_can\\_create\\_account setting of the authentication\n>   method and generates an email with a token in it which the\n>   user can use to create an account. Depending on the\n>   authentication method being active, this could allow the\n>   user to log in using this account.\n>   Installations where the createemailregexp parameter is\n>   empty are not vulnerable to this issue.\n> * The creation of bug reports and of attachments is not\n>   protected by a token and so they can be created without the\n>   consent of a user if the relevant code is embedded in an\n>   HTML page and the user visits this page. This behavior was\n>   intentional to let third-party applications submit new bug\n>   reports and attachments easily. But as this behavior can be\n>   abused by a malicious user, it has been decided to block\n>   submissions with no valid token starting from version 4.2rc1.\n>   Older branches are not patched to not break these third-party\n>   applications after the upgrade.\n>\n> All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon\n> as possible.",

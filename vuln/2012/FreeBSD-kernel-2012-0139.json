Depending on the value of the\n> uninitialized portion of the IPv6 address, it is possible for the\n> IPv4 network number to match when it should not. This bug only\n> affects IP network matching and does not affect simple IP address\n> matching.\n>\n> The reported configuration that exhibited the bug was an\n> LDAP-based sudo installation where the sudoRole object contained\n> multiple sudoHost entries, each containing a different IPv4\n> network. File-based sudoers should be affected as well as the\n> same matching code is used.",

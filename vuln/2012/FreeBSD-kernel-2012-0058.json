A sample exploit for the issue was\n> included in the notification.\n>\n> The vulnerability was created in commit a368a6f4f4aaf on\n> August 18, 2010. Vulnerable versions include 2.1.10, 2.1.11,\n> and 2.1.12. Also anyone running the git \"master\" branch\n> after August 18, 2010 is vulnerable.\n>\n> All sites using TLS-based EAP methods and the above\n> versions are vulnerable. The only configuration change which\n> can avoid the issue is to disable EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and\n> PEAP.\n>\n> An external attacker can use this vulnerability to\n> over-write the stack frame of the RADIUS server, and cause\n> it to crash. In addition, more sophisticated attacks may\n> gain additional privileges on the system running the RADIUS\n> server.\n>\n> This attack does not require local network access to the\n> RADIUS server. It can be done by an attacker through a WiFi\n> Access Point, so long as the Access Point is configured to\n> use 802.1X authentication with the RADIUS server.",

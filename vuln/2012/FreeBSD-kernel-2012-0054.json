The first vulnerability in Jenkins core allows unprivileged\n>    users to insert data into Jenkins master, which can lead to\n>    remote code execution. For this vulnerability to be exploited,\n>    the attacker must have an HTTP access to a Jenkins master, and\n>    he must have a read access to Jenkins.\n> 2. The second vulnerability in Jenkins core is a cross-site\n>    scripting vulnerability. This allows an attacker to craft an URL\n>    that points to Jenkins, and if a legitimate user clicks this link,\n>    and the attacker will be able to hijack the user session.\n> 3. The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n>    in the Violations plugin\n> 4. The fourth vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n>    in The Continuous Integration Game plugin",

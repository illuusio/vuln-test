This update\n> patches security holes associated with libxml2 and libxslt, similar to\n> those affecting other open source projects. All users are urged to\n> update their installations at the first available opportunity\n>\n> Users who are relying on the built-in XML functionality to validate\n> external DTDs will need to implement a workaround, as this security\n> patch disables that functionality. Users who are using xslt_process()\n> to fetch documents or stylesheets from external URLs will no longer be\n> able to do so. The PostgreSQL project regrets the need to disable both\n> of these features in order to maintain our security standards. These\n> security issues with XML are substantially similar to issues patched\n> recently by the Webkit (CVE-2011-1774), XMLsec (CVE-2011-1425) and\n> PHP5 (CVE-2012-0057) projects.\n",

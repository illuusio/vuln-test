Morgan reports:\n\n> In December 2011, VSR identified a vulnerability in multiple open\n> source office products (including OpenOffice, LibreOffice, KOffice,\n> and AbiWord) due to unsafe interpretation of XML files with custom\n> entity declarations. Deeper analysis revealed that the vulnerability\n> was caused by acceptance of external entities by the libraptor\n> library, which is used by librdf and is in turn used by these office\n> products.\n>\n> In the context of office applications, these vulnerabilities could\n> allow for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks resulting in file theft\n> and a loss of user privacy when opening potentially malicious ODF\n> documents. For other applications which depend on librdf or libraptor,\n> potentially serious consequences could result from accepting RDF/XML\n> content from untrusted sources, though the impact may vary widely\n> depending on the context.\n",

This update patches security holes associated with\n> libxml2 and libxslt, similar to those affecting other open\n> source projects. All users are urged to update their\n> installations at the first available opportunity\n>\n> Users who are relying on the built-in XML functionality to\n> validate external DTDs will need to implement a workaround, as\n> this security patch disables that functionality. Users who are\n> using xslt\\_process() to fetch documents or stylesheets from\n> external URLs will no longer be able to do so. The PostgreSQL\n> project regrets the need to disable both of these features in\n> order to maintain our security standards. These security issues\n> with XML are substantially similar to issues patched recently\n> by the Webkit (CVE-2011-1774), XMLsec (CVE-2011-1425) and PHP5\n> (CVE-2012-0057) projects.",

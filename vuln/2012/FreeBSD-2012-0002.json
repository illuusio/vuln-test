This text is not\n>   correctly escaped and a crafted URL could use this vulnerability to\n>   inject code leading to XSS.\n> - The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method ignores the\n>   user_can_create_account setting of the authentication method and\n>   generates an email with a token in it which the user can use to\n>   create an account. Depending on the authentication method being\n>   active, this could allow the user to log in using this account.\n>   Installations where the createemailregexp parameter is empty are not\n>   vulnerable to this issue.\n> - The creation of bug reports and of attachments is not protected by a\n>   token and so they can be created without the consent of a user if\n>   the relevant code is embedded in an HTML page and the user visits\n>   this page. This behavior was intentional to let third-party\n>   applications submit new bug reports and attachments easily. But as\n>   this behavior can be abused by a malicious user, it has been decided\n>   to block submissions with no valid token starting from version\n>   4.2rc1. Older branches are not patched to not break these\n>   third-party applications after the upgrade.\n>\n> All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as\n> possible.\n",

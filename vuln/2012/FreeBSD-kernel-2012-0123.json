This vulnerability therefore\n> impacts upon many public facing MantisBT installations.\n>\n> Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) found that the\n> delete\\_attachments\\_threshold permission was not being checked when\n> a user attempted to delete an attachment from an issue. The more\n> generic update\\_bug\\_threshold permission was being checked instead.\n> MantisBT administrators may have been under the false impression\n> that their configuration of the delete\\_attachments\\_threshold was\n> successfully preventing unwanted users from deleting\n> attachments.",

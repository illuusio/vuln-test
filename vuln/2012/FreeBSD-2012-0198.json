This\n> vulnerability has been reported as CVE-2012-4522.\n>\n> Ruby can handle arbitrary binary patterns as Strings, including NUL\n> chars. On the other hand OSes and other libraries tend not. They\n> usually treat a NUL as an End of String mark. So to interface them\n> with Ruby, NUL chars should properly be avoided.\n>\n> However methods like IO#open did not check the filename passed to\n> them, and just passed those strings to lower layer routines. This led\n> to create unintentional files.\n",

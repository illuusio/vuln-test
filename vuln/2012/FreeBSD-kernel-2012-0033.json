On the other hand OSes and other libraries tend not.\n> They usually treat a NUL as an End of String mark. So to interface\n> them with Ruby, NUL chars should properly be avoided.\n>\n> However methods like IO#open did not check the filename passed to\n> them, and just passed those strings to lower layer routines. This\n> led to create unintentional files.",

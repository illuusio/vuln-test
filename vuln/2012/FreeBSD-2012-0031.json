Not verifying that\n> attributes being passed through AX have been signed could allow an\n> attacker to modify users\\' information.\n>\n> This issue affects Drupal 6.x and 7.x.\n>\n> ### Access bypass in File module\n>\n> CVE: CVE-2012-0827\n>\n> When using private files in combination with certain field access\n> modules, the File module will allow users to download the file even if\n> they do not have access to view the field it was attached to.\n>\n> This issue affects Drupal 7.x only.\n",

Arbitrary PHP code execution\n>\n>     A bug in the installer code was identified that allows an attacker\n>     to re-install Drupal using an external database server under\n>     certain transient conditions. This could allow the attacker to\n>     execute arbitrary PHP code on the original server.\n>\n> 2.  Information disclosure - OpenID module\n>\n>     For sites using the core OpenID module, an information disclosure\n>     vulnerability was identified that allows an attacker to read files\n>     on the local filesystem by attempting to log in to the site using\n>     a malicious OpenID server.\n",

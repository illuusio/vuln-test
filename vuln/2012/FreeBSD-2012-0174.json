This could be an issue if the HTTP\n> server has access to machines that are not otherwise publicly visible.\n>\n> The second problem would permit a hostile third party to execute\n> JavaScript in users\\' browsers in context of the domain running\n> mod_pagespeed, which could permit interception of users\\' cookies or\n> data on the site.\n>\n> Because of the severity of the two problems, users are strongly\n> encouraged to update immediately.\n>\n> Behavior Changes in the Update:\n>\n> As part of the fix to the first issue, mod_pagespeed will not fetch\n> resources from machines other than localhost if they are not\n> explicitly mentioned in the configuration. This means that if you need\n> resources on the server\\'s domain to be handled by some other system,\n> you\\'ll need to explicitly use ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain or\n> ModPagespeedDomain to authorize that.\n",

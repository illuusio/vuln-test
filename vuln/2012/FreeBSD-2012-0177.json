The first vulnerability in Jenkins core allows unprivileged users\n>     to insert data into Jenkins master, which can lead to remote code\n>     execution. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the attacker\n>     must have an HTTP access to a Jenkins master, and he must have a\n>     read access to Jenkins.\n> 2.  The second vulnerability in Jenkins core is a cross-site scripting\n>     vulnerability. This allows an attacker to craft an URL that points\n>     to Jenkins, and if a legitimate user clicks this link, and the\n>     attacker will be able to hijack the user session.\n> 3.  The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in\n>     the Violations plugin\n> 4.  The fourth vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n>     in The Continuous Integration Game plugin\n",

The program name can be controlled by the caller,\n> either via a symbolic link or, on some systems, by setting argv[0]\n> when executing sudo.\n>\n> Using standard format string vulnerability exploitation\n> techniques it is possible to leverage this bug to achieve root\n> privileges.\n>\n> Exploitation of the bug does not require that the attacker be\n> listed in the sudoers file. As such, we strongly suggest that\n> affected sites upgrade from affected sudo versions as soon as\n> possible.",

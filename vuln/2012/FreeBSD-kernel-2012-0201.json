Such email\n>   addresses could look visually identical to other valid email\n>   addresses, and an attacker could try to confuse other users\n>   and be added to bugs he shouldn't have access to.\n> * Cross-Site Request Forgery:\n>   Due to a lack of validation of the Content-Type head when\n>   making POST requests to jsonrpc.cgi, a possible CSRF\n>   vulnerability was discovered. If a user visits an HTML page\n>   with some malicious JS code in it, an attacker could make\n>   changes to a remote Bugzilla installation on behalf of the\n>   victim's account by using the JSON-RPC API. The user would\n>   have had to be already logged in to the target site for the\n>   vulnerability to work.\n>\n> All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as\n> possible.",

The\n> host specification may be in the form of a host name, a netgroup, an\n> IP address, or an IP network (an IP address with an associated\n> netmask).\n>\n> When IPv6 support was added to sudo, a bug was introduced that caused\n> the IPv6 network matching code to be called when an IPv4 network\n> address does not match. Depending on the value of the uninitialized\n> portion of the IPv6 address, it is possible for the IPv4 network\n> number to match when it should not. This bug only affects IP network\n> matching and does not affect simple IP address matching.\n>\n> The reported configuration that exhibited the bug was an LDAP-based\n> sudo installation where the sudoRole object contained multiple\n> sudoHost entries, each containing a different IPv4 network. File-based\n> sudoers should be affected as well as the same matching code is used.\n",

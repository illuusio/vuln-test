Once downloading the map\n> no other downloads of the map can start, so downloading really slowly\n> will prevent others from joining. This can be further aggravated by\n> the pause-on-join setting in which case the game is paused and the\n> players cannot continue the game during such an attack. This attack\n> requires that the user is not banned and passes the authorization to\n> the server, although for many servers there is no server password and\n> thus authorization is easy.\n",

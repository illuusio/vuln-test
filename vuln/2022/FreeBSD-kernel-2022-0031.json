This\n> creates an unusual behavior, where *user\\_1* can register with one email\n> address and *user\\_2* can register their username as *user\\_1*\u2019s\n> email address. As a result, *user\\_1* would be prevented from signing\n> in to Grafana, since *user\\_1* password won\u2019t match with *user\\_2*\n> email address.\n>\n> The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 moderate\n> (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).",

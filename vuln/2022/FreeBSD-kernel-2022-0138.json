Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not send the\n>   X-Forwarded-\\* headers to the origin server based on client side\n>   Connection header hop-by-hop mechanism. This may be used to bypass\n>   IP based authentication on the origin server/application.\n> * CVE-2022-30556: Information Disclosure in mod\\_lua with websockets.\n>   Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths to\n>   applications calling r:wsread() that point past the end of the\n>   storage allocated for the buffer.\n> * CVE-2022-30522: mod\\_sed denial of service. If Apache HTTP Server\n>   2.4.53 is configured to do transformations with mod\\_sed in contexts\n>   where the input to mod\\_sed may be very large, mod\\_sed may make\n>   excessively large memory allocations and trigger an abort.\n> * CVE-2022-29404: Denial of service in mod\\_lua r:parsebody. In Apache\n>   HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a lua script\n>   that calls r:parsebody(0) may cause a denial of service due to no\n>   default limit on possible input size.\n> * CVE-2022-28615: Read beyond bounds in ap\\_strcmp\\_match(). Apache\n>   HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due\n>   to a read beyond bounds in ap\\_strcmp\\_match() when provided with an\n>   extremely large input buffer. While no code distributed with the\n>   server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua\n>   scripts that use ap\\_strcmp\\_match() may hypothetically be affected.\n> * CVE-2022-28614: read beyond bounds via ap\\_rwrite(). The ap\\_rwrite()\n>   function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may read unintended\n>   memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large\n>   input using ap\\_rwrite() or ap\\_rputs(), such as with mod\\_luas r:puts()\n>   function.\n> * CVE-2022-28330: read beyond bounds in mod\\_isapi. Apache HTTP Server\n>   2.4.53 and earlier on Windows may read beyond bounds when configured\n>   to process requests with the mod\\_isapi module.\n> * CVE-2022-26377: mod\\_proxy\\_ajp: Possible request smuggling.\n>   Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request\n>   Smuggling') vulnerability in mod\\_proxy\\_ajp of Apache HTTP Server\n>   allows an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards\n>   requests to.",

When zgrep is applied on the attacker\\'s chosen file name\n> (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker\\'s\n> content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due\n> to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more\n> newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded\n> in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low\n> privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the\n> system.\n",

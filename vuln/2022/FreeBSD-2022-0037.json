This\n> meant that a caller could freely control what file path would be\n> unlinked and replaced with a user-owned seatd socket for the duration\n> of the session.\n>\n> If seatd-launch had the SUID bit set, this could be used by a\n> malicious user to remove files with the privileges of the owner of\n> seatd-launch, which is likely root, and replace it with a user-owned\n> domain socket.\n>\n> This does not directly allow retrieving the contents of existing\n> files, and the user-owned socket file is at the current time not\n> believed to be directly useful for further exploitation.\n",

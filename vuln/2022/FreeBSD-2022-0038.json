It occurs\n> because the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain\n> path traversal characters (ie \\`../../name.json\\`). The impact is\n> mitigated by a few facts: It only affects implementations that allow\n> arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata, The\n> attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the\n> path-traversing role and B) get the role delegated by an existing\n> targets metadata, The written file content is heavily restricted since\n> it needs to be a valid, signed targets file. The file extension is\n> always .json. A fix is available in version 0.19 or newer. There are\n> no workarounds that do not require code changes. Clients can restrict\n> the allowed character set for rolenames, or they can store metadata in\n> files named in a way that is not vulnerable: neither of these\n> approaches is possible without modifying python-tuf.\n",

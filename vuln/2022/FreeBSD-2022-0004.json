As the second half, fix uriFreeUriMembers\\* functions that\n> would not free .hostText memory for URIs with an IPv4 or IPv6 address\n> host; also, calling uriFreeUriMembers\\* multiple times on a URI of\n> this very nature would result in trying to free pointers to stack\n> (rather than heap) memory. Fix functions uriNormalizeSyntax\\* for\n> out-of-memory situations (i.e. malloc returning NULL) for URIs\n> containing empty segments (any of user info, host text, query, or\n> fragment) where previously pointers to stack (rather than heap) memory\n> were freed.\n",

    "details": "Daniel Stenberg reports:\n\n> \n>\n> CVE-2022-32221: POST following PUT confusion\n> :   When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the\n>     read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send,\n>     even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the\n>     same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which\n>     used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and\n>     cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use\n>     memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The\n>     problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed\n>     from a PUT to a POST.\n>\n> CVE-2022-35260: .netrc parser out-of-bounds access\n> :   curl can be told to parse a .netrc file for credentials. If that\n>     file ends in a line with consecutive non-white space letters and\n>     no newline, curl could read past the end of the stack-based\n>     buffer, and if the read works, write a zero byte possibly beyond\n>     its boundary. This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar,\n>     but circumstances might also cause different outcomes. If a\n>     malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application\n>     or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as\n>     denial-of-service.\n>\n> CVE-2022-42915: HTTP proxy double-free\n> :   f curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a\n>     non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by\n>     issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and then tunnels the rest\n>     of protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP\n>     proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port\n>     numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 response\n>     code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling,\n>     this could trigger a double-free in curl if one of the following\n>     schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher,\n>     gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, telnet\n>\n> CVE-2022-42916: HSTS bypass via IDN\n> :   curl\\'s HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using\n>     HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS\n>     directly instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even\n>     when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed\n>     if the host name in the given URL uses IDN characters that get\n>     replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like\n>     using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead\n>     of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) .. Like this:\n>     http://curl\u3002se\u3002\n",

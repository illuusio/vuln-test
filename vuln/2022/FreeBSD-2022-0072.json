    "details": "# Problem Description:\n\nThe e1000 network adapters permit a variety of modifications to an\nEthernet packet when it is being transmitted. These include the\ninsertion of IP and TCP checksums, insertion of an Ethernet VLAN header,\nand TCP segmentation offload (\\\"TSO\\\"). The e1000 device model uses an\non-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when simulating\nthese modifications on transmitted packets.\n\nWhen checksum offload is requested for a transmitted packet, the e1000\ndevice model used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum offset\nin the on-stack buffer. The offset was not validated for certain packet\ntypes.\n\n# Impact:\n\nA misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve process on\nthe host, possibly leading to code execution in the host context.\n\nThe bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox, which (depending on the\nFreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of exploiting\nthis issue.\n",

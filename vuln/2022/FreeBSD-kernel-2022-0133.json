While\n> mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see\n> multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of\n> another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and\n> does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may\n> have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization.\n>\n> Unless you use mitmproxy to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required.",

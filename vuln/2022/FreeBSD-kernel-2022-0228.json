Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint\n> that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can\n> use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o.\n>\n> This internal state includes traffic of other connections in\n> unencrypted form and TLS session tickets.\n>\n> This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3\n> support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65.

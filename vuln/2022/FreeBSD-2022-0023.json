When h2o is used as a\n> reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send\n> internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or\n> third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the\n> traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that reflector to\n> obtain internal state of h2o.\n>\n> This internal state includes traffic of other connections in\n> unencrypted form and TLS session tickets.\n>\n> This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between\n> commit 93af138 and d1f0f65.

Node.js was accepting URI SAN types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.\n>\n> Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection (Medium)(CVE-2021-44532)\n> =============================================================================\n>\n> Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format. It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.\n>\n> Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533)\n> ====================================================================================\n>\n> Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.\n>\n> Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)\n> ========================================================================\n>\n> Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the `properties` parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be `__proto__`. The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an empty string to be assigned to numerical keys of the object prototype.",

The\nNRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a\nconsiderable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by\nquerying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive\nnameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of\ntime/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point\nwhere a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can\ntrigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually\nlook in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation.\n\n> .\n",

The NRDelegation Attack works by having\na malicious delegation with a considerable number of non\nresponsive nameservers. The attack starts by querying a\nresolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive\nnameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot\nof time/resources resolving records under a malicious\ndelegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive\nNS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some\nresolver implementations that continually look in the cache\nfor resolved NS records in that delegation.\n\n> .",

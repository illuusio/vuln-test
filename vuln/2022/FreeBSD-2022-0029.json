Node.js was accepting URI\n> SAN types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when\n> a protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.\n>\n> # Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection (Medium)(CVE-2021-44532)\n>\n> Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format.\n> It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when\n> validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection\n> vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate\n> chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.\n>\n> # Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533)\n>\n> Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names\n> correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a\n> single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as\n> a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to\n> inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate\n> subject verification.\n>\n> # Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)\n>\n> Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was\n> not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the\n> `properties` parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object\n> with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be\n> `__proto__`. The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that\n> it only allows an empty string to be assigned to numerical keys of the\n> object prototype.\n",

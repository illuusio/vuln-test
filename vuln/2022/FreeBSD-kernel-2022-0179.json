    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nThe e1000 network adapters permit a variety of modifications to an\nEthernet packet when it is being transmitted. These include the\ninsertion of IP and TCP checksums, insertion of an Ethernet VLAN\nheader, and TCP segmentation offload (\"TSO\"). The e1000 device model\nuses an on-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when\nsimulating these modifications on transmitted packets.\n\nWhen checksum offload is requested for a transmitted packet, the\ne1000 device model used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum\noffset in the on-stack buffer. The offset was not validated for\ncertain packet types.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nA misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve\nprocess on the host, possibly leading to code execution in the host\ncontext.\n\nThe bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox, which (depending on\nthe FreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of\nexploiting this issue.",

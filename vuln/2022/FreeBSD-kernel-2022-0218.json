Note that Unmarshal will never return such values.\n\n> math/big: prevent large memory consumption in Rat.SetString\n>\n> An attacker can cause unbounded memory growth in a program using\n> (\\*Rat).SetString due to an unhandled overflow.\n\n> cmd/go: prevent branches from materializing into versions\n>\n> A branch whose name resembles a version tag (such as \"v1.0.0\" or\n> \"subdir/v2.0.0-dev\") can be considered a valid version by the go\n> command. Materializing versions from branches might be unexpected\n> and bypass ACLs that limit the creation of tags but not branches.",

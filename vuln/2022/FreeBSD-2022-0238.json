These functions permitted access to\n> Windows device files under that root. For example,\n> os.DirFS(\\\"C:/tmp\\\").Open(\\\"COM1\\\") would open the COM1 device. Both\n> os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access.\n>\n> In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory \\\\(the root of\n> the current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape\n> from the drive and access any path on the system.\n>\n> The behavior of os.DirFS(\\\"\\\") has changed. Previously, an empty root\n> was treated equivalently to \\\"/\\\", so os.DirFS(\\\"\\\").Open(\\\"tmp\\\")\n> would open the path \\\"/tmp\\\". This now returns an error.\n\n> net/http: limit canonical header cache by bytes, not entries\n>\n> An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting\n> HTTP/2 requests. HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP\n> header keys sent by the client. While the total number of entries in\n> this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause\n> the server to allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.\n",

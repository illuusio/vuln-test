    "details": "Due to a mistake in error handling, data in RRDP snapshot and delta\nfiles that isn't correctly base 64 encoded is treated as a fatal error\nand causes Routinator to exit. Worst case impact of this vulnerability\nis denial of service for the RPKI data that Routinator provides to\nrouters. This may stop your network from validating route origins based\non RPKI data. This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to\nmanipulate RPKI data. We are not aware of exploitation of this\nvulnerability at this point in time. Starting with release 0.11.3,\nRoutinator handles encoding errors by rejecting the snapshot or delta\nfile and continuing with validation. In case of an invalid delta file,\nit will try using the snapshot instead. If a snapshot file is invalid,\nthe update of the repository will fail and an update through rsync is\nattempted.\n\n> .\n",

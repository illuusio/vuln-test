In the case where the (non-default) flag\n>   OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a\n>   successful verification) even in the case where the response signing\n>   certificate fails to verify.\n> - Incorrect MAC key used in the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite (CVE-2022-1434)\n>   (Low)\\\n>   The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite\n>   incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key\n>   trivially predictable.\n> - Resource leakage when decoding certificates and keys (CVE-2022-1473)\n>   (Low)\\\n>   The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table,\n>   containsa bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the\n>   removed hash table entries.\n",

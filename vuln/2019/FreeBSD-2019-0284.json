After this fix,\n> file_save_upload() now trims leading and trailing dots from filenames.\n\n> The Media Library module has a security vulnerability whereby it\n> doesn\\'t sufficiently restrict access to media items in certain\n> configurations.\n\n> The Drupal project uses the third-party library Archive_Tar, which has\n> released a security-related feature that impacts some Drupal\n> configurations. Multiple vulnerabilities are possible if Drupal is\n> configured to allow .tar, .tar.gz, .bz2 or .tlz file uploads and\n> processes them. The latest versions of Drupal update Archive_Tar to\n> 1.4.9 to mitigate the file processing vulnerabilities.\n",

EAP-pwd\nuses a similar design for deriving PWE from the password and while a\nspecific attack against EAP-pwd is not yet known to be tested, there is\nno reason to believe that the EAP-pwd implementation would be immune\nagainst the type of cache attack that was identified for the SAE\nimplementation. Since the EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server)\nand wpa_supplicant (EAP peer) does not support MODP groups, the timing\nattack described against SAE is not applicable for the EAP-pwd\nimplementation.\n\nSee https://w1.fi/security/2019-2/eap-pwd-side-channel-attack.txt for a\ndetailed description of the bug.\n\n# Impact:\n\nAll wpa_supplicant and hostapd versions with EAP-pwd support\n(CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled\nin the runtime configuration).\n",

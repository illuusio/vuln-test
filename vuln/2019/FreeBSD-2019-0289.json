This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12\n> and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using\n> timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually\n> stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for\n> speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the\n> amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able\n> to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session id\n> itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed\n> by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.\n",

For nghttpx, additionally limiting inbound traffic by\n> \\--read-rate and \\--read-burst options is quite effective against this\n> kind of attack.\n>\n> CVE-2019-9511 \\\"Data Dribble\\\": The attacker requests a large amount\n> of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They\n> manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to\n> queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this\n> data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both,\n> potentially leading to a denial of service.\n>\n> CVE-2019-9513 \\\"Ping Flood\\\": The attacker sends continual pings to an\n> HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.\n> Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume\n> excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of\n> service.\n",

This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12\n> and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using\n> timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored\n> and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up\n> lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time\n> it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid\n> session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be\n> generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing\n> store does not use a secure comparison.",

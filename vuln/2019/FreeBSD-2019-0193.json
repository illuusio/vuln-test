Among the vulnerabilities, H2O is\n> exposed to the following:\n>\n> - CVE-2019-9512 \\\"Ping Flood\\\": The attacker sends continual pings to\n>   an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of\n>   responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this\n>   can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a\n>   denial of service.\n> - CVE-2019-9514 \\\"Reset Flood\\\": The attacker opens a number of\n>   streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should\n>   solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on\n>   how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess\n>   memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n> - CVE-2019-9515 \\\"Settings Flood\\\": The attacker sends a stream of\n>   SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer\n>   reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS\n>   frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how\n>   efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU,\n>   memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n",

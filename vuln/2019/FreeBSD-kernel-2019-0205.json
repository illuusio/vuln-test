Since the EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP\nserver) and wpa\\_supplicant (EAP peer) does not support MODP groups,\nthe timing attack described against SAE is not applicable for the\nEAP-pwd implementation.\n\nSee\nhttps://w1.fi/security/2019-2/eap-pwd-side-channel-attack.txt\nfor a detailed description of the bug.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nAll wpa\\_supplicant and hostapd versions with EAP-pwd support\n(CONFIG\\_EAP\\_PWD=y in the build configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled\nin the runtime configuration).",

The deterministic ECDSA function\n> reused this by passing the RNG object created from the private key\n> and the message to be signed as prescribed by RFC 6979. This meant\n> that the same RNG object was used whenever the same message was\n> signed, rendering the blinding ineffective.\n>\n> If the victim can be tricked to sign the same message repeatedly,\n> the private key may be recoverable through side channels.",

It\n> calls recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather than\n> with the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that\n> might overwrite the heap memory is entirely controlled by the server.\n>\n> The flaw exists if the user selects to use a \"blksize\" of 504 or\n> smaller (default is 512). The smaller size that is used, the larger\n> the possible overflow becomes.\n>\n> Users chosing a smaller size than default should be rare as the\n> primary use case for changing the size is to make it larger.\n>\n> It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most\n> commonly used within local networks.",

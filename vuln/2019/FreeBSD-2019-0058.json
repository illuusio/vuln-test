This can be used to cause a denial of service by preventing\n> the remote backend from getting a response, content spoofing if the\n> attacker can time its own query so that subsequent queries will use an\n> attacker-controlled HTTP server instead of the configured one, and\n> possibly information disclosure if the Authoritative Server has access\n> to internal servers.\n",

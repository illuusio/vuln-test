    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nWhile processing acknowledgements, the RACK code uses\nseveral linked lists to maintain state entries. A malicious\nattacker can cause the lists to grow unbounded. This can\ncause an expensive list traversal on every packet being\nprocessed, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of\nservice.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nAn attacker with the ability to send specially crafted\nTCP traffic to a victim system can degrade network performance\nand/or consume excessive CPU by exploiting the inefficiency\nof traversing the potentially very large RACK linked lists\nwith relatively small bandwidth cost.",

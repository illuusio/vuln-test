An Open Redirect Vulnerability is when a\n> malicious person crafts a link pointing to the login page of a trusted\n> site, but setting the \"redirect after successful login\" parameter to\n> send the user to their own site, instead of a page on the authenticated\n> site (the notebook or JupyterHub server), e.g.\n> /login?next=http://badwebsite.biz. This doesn't necessarily compromise\n> anything immediately, but it enables phishing if users don't notice\n> that the domain has changed, e.g. by showing a fake \"re-enter your\n> password\" page. Servers generally have to validate the redirect URL to\n> avoid this. Both JupyterHub and Notebook already do this, but the\n> validation didn't take into account all possible ways to redirect to\n> other sites, so some malicious URLs could still be crafted to redirect\n> away from the server (the above example does not work in any recent\n> version of either package). Only certain browsers (Chrome and Firefox,\n> not Safari) could be redirected from the JupyterHub login page, but all\n> browsers could be redirected away from a standalone notebook server.",

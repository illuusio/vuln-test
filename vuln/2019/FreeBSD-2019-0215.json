The deterministic ECDSA function\n> reused this by passing the RNG object created from the private key and\n> the message to be signed as prescribed by RFC 6979. This meant that\n> the same RNG object was used whenever the same message was signed,\n> rendering the blinding ineffective.\n>\n> If the victim can be tricked to sign the same message repeatedly, the\n> private key may be recoverable through side channels.\n",

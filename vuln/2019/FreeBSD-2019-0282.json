No EC algorithms are\n> affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024,\n> 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very\n> difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against\n> DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target\n> would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended\n> anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp\n> may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.\n",

We\\'re still investigating how and when, but the\n> exploitable code has never existed in our github repositories, so\n> we\\'ve rebuilt from git source on new infrastructure (and checked to\n> be sure the result does not contain the malicious code).\n>\n> I don\\'t have a changelog for these releases yet, but I wanted to\n> announce them immediately due to the severity of this issue. To\n> exploit the malicious code, your Webmin installation must have Webmin\n> -\\> Webmin Configuration -\\> Authentication -\\> Password expiry policy\n> set to Prompt users with expired passwords to enter a new one. This\n> option is not set by default, but if it is set, it allows remote code\n> execution.\n>\n> This release addresses CVE-2019-15107, which was disclosed earlier\n> today. It also addresses a handful of XSS issues that we were notified\n> about, and a bounty was awarded to the researcher (a different one)\n> who found them.\n",

A stack- based overflow is present in the\nhandling of environment variables when connecting via the\ntelnet client to remote telnet servers.\n\nThis issue only affects the telnet client. Inbound telnet\nsessions to telnetd(8) are not affected by this issue.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nThese buffer overflows may be triggered when connecting\nto a malicious server, or by an active attacker in the\nnetwork path between the client and server. Specially crafted\nTELNET command sequences may cause the execution of arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user invoking telnet(1).",

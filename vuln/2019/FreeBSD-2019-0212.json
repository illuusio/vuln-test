Also, Kerberos\n> authentication is usually only attempted and used with servers that\n> the client has a previous association with.\n>\n> CVE-2019-5482: TFTP small blocksize heap buffer overflow\n>\n> libcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function\n> (tftp_receive_packet()) that receives data from a TFTP server. It can\n> call recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather than with\n> the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might\n> overwrite the heap memory is controlled by the server.\n>\n> This flaw is only triggered if the TFTP server sends an OACK without\n> the BLKSIZE option, when a BLKSIZE smaller than 512 bytes was\n> requested by the TFTP client. OACK is a TFTP extension and is not used\n> by all TFTP servers.\n>\n> Users choosing a smaller block size than default should be rare as the\n> primary use case for changing the size is to make it larger.\n>\n> It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most\n> commonly used within local networks. TFTP as a protocol is always\n> inherently insecure.\n>\n> This issue was introduced by the add of the TFTP BLKSIZE option\n> handling. It was previously incompletely fixed by an almost identical\n> issue called CVE-2019-5436.\n",

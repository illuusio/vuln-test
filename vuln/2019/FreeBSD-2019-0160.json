    "details": "# Problem Description:\n\nWhile processing acknowledgements, the RACK code uses several linked\nlists to maintain state entries. A malicious attacker can cause the\nlists to grow unbounded. This can cause an expensive list traversal on\nevery packet being processed, leading to resource exhaustion and a\ndenial of service.\n\n# Impact:\n\nAn attacker with the ability to send specially crafted TCP traffic to a\nvictim system can degrade network performance and/or consume excessive\nCPU by exploiting the inefficiency of traversing the potentially very\nlarge RACK linked lists with relatively small bandwidth cost.\n",

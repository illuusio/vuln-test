Specially crafted\n> HTTP/2 frames cause Denial of Service by consuming CPU time. Check out\n> https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md\n> for details. For nghttpx, additionally limiting inbound traffic by\n> --read-rate and --read-burst options is quite effective against this\n> kind of attack.\n>\n> CVE-2019-9511 \"Data Dribble\": The attacker requests a large amount of\n> data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate\n> window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in\n> 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this\n> can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a\n> denial of service.\n>\n> CVE-2019-9513 \"Ping Flood\": The attacker sends continual pings to an\n> HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.\n> Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume\n> excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.",

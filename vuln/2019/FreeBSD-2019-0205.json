In a particular transcoding\n> scenario this audio frame would get turned into a frame with no origin\n> information. If this new frame was then given to the audio transcoding\n> support a crash would occur as no samples and no origin information\n> would be present. The transcoding scenario requires the genericplc\n> option to be set to enabled (the default) and a transcoding path from\n> the source format into signed linear and then from signed linear into\n> another format.\n>\n> Note that there may be other scenarios that have not been found which\n> can cause an audio frame with no origin to be given to the audio\n> transcoding support and thus cause a crash.\n",

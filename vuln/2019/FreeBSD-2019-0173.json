The result\n>   of this is Undefined Behavior with respect to the array bounds\n>   checking conditions that BinPAC generates, so it\\'s unpredictable\n>   what an optimizing compiler may actually do under the assumption\n>   that signed integer overlows should never happen. The specific\n>   symptom which lead to finding this issue was with the PE analyzer\n>   causing out-of-memory crashes due to large allocations that were\n>   otherwise prevented when the array bounds checking logic was changed\n>   to prevent any possible signed integer overlow.\n",

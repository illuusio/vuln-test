A local attacker may use this flaw to read beyond the end of the buffer or to crash the program.\n>\n> CVE-2019-10649: In ImageMagick 7.0.8-36 Q16, there is a memory leak in the function SVGKeyValuePairs of coders/svg.c, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted image file.\n>\n> CVE-2019-10650: In ImageMagick 7.0.8-36 Q16, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function WriteTIFFImage of coders/tiff.c, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or information disclosure via a crafted image file.\n>\n> CVE-2019-10714: LocaleLowercase in MagickCore/locale.c in ImageMagick before 7.0.8-32 allows out-of-bounds access, leading to a SIGSEGV.\n>\n> CVE-2019-11470: The cineon parsing component in ImageMagick 7.0.8-26 Q16 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (uncontrolled resource consumption) by crafting a Cineon image with an incorrect claimed image size. This occurs because ReadCINImage in coders/cin.c lacks a check for insufficient image data in a file.\n>\n> CVE-2019-11472: ReadXWDImage in coders/xwd.c in the XWD image parsing component of ImageMagick 7.0.8-41 Q16 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (divide-by-zero error) by crafting an XWD image file in which the header indicates neither LSB first nor MSB first.\n>\n> CVE-2019-11597: In ImageMagick 7.0.8-43 Q16, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function WriteTIFFImage of coders/tiff.c, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly information disclosure via a crafted image file.\n>\n> CVE-2019-11598: In ImageMagick 7.0.8-40 Q16, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function WritePNMImage of coders/pnm.c, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly information disclosure via a crafted image file.

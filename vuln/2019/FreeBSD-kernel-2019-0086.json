This change assumed that information\n> about the origin of a frame will always exist when in\n> reality it may not.\n>\n> This issue presented itself when an RTP packet containing\n> no audio (and thus no samples) was received. In a particular\n> transcoding scenario this audio frame would get turned\n> into a frame with no origin information. If this new frame\n> was then given to the audio transcoding support a crash\n> would occur as no samples and no origin information would\n> be present. The transcoding scenario requires the genericplc\n> option to be set to enabled (the default) and a transcoding\n> path from the source format into signed linear and then\n> from signed linear into another format.\n>\n> Note that there may be other scenarios that have not\n> been found which can cause an audio frame with no origin\n> to be given to the audio transcoding support and thus\n> cause a crash.",

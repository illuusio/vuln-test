We're still investigating how and when, but the\n> exploitable code has never existed in our github repositories, so\n> we've rebuilt from git source on new infrastructure (and checked\n> to be sure the result does not contain the malicious code).\n>\n> I don't have a changelog for these releases yet, but I wanted\n> to announce them immediately due to the severity of this issue.\n> To exploit the malicious code, your Webmin installation must have\n> Webmin -> Webmin Configuration -> Authentication -> Password\n> expiry policy set to Prompt users with expired passwords to enter\n> a new one. This option is not set by default, but if it is set,\n> it allows remote code execution.\n>\n> This release addresses CVE-2019-15107, which was disclosed\n> earlier today. It also addresses a handful of XSS issues that we\n> were notified about, and a bounty was awarded to the researcher\n> (a different one) who found them.",

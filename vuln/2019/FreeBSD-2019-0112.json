One such example,\n>   reported by Maksim Shudrak, causes the Kerberos analyzer to\n>   dereference a null pointer. CVE-2019-12175 was assigned for this\n>   issue.\n> - The Kerberos parser allows for several fields to be left\n>   uninitialized, but they were not marked with an &optional attribute\n>   and several usages lacked existence checks. Crafted packet data\n>   could potentially cause an attempt to access such uninitialized\n>   fields, generate a runtime error/exception, and leak memory.\n>   Existence checks and &optional attributes have been added to the\n>   relevent Kerberos fields.\n> - BinPAC-generated protocol parsers commonly contain fields whose\n>   length is derived from other packet input, and for those that allow\n>   for incremental parsing, BinPAC did not impose a limit on how large\n>   such a field could grow, allowing for remotely-controlled packet\n>   data to cause growth of BinPAC\\'s flowbuffer bounded only by the\n>   numeric limit of an unsigned 64-bit integer, leading to memory\n>   exhaustion. There is now a generalized limit for how large\n>   flowbuffers are allowed to grow, tunable by setting\n>   \\\"BinPAC::flowbuffer_capacity_max\\\".\n",

In this situation,\n> fetchmail would resize the buffer and fill in further parts of the\n> message, but forget to reinitialize its va_list typed source pointer,\n> thus reading data from a garbage address found on the stack at\n> addresses above the function arguments the caller passed in; usually\n> that would be the caller\\'s stack frame.\n",

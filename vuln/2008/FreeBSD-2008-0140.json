    "details": "Andreas Kurtz reports:\n\n> The jabber server Openfire (\\<= version 3.6.0a) contains several\n> serious vulnerabilities. Depending on the particular runtime\n> environment these issues can potentially even be used by an attacker\n> to execute code on operating system level.\n>\n> 1.  Authentication bypass - This vulnerability provides an attacker\n>     full access to all functions in the admin webinterface without\n>     providing any user credentials. The Tomcat filter which is\n>     responsible for authentication could be completely circumvented.\n> 2.  SQL injection - It is possible to pass SQL statements to the\n>     backend database through a SQL injection vulnerability. Depending\n>     on the particular runtime environment and database permissions it\n>     is even possible to write files to disk and execute code on\n>     operating system level.\n> 3.  Multiple Cross-Site Scripting - Permits arbitrary insertion of\n>     HTML- and JavaScript code in login.jsp. An attacker could also\n>     manipulate a parameter to specify a destination to which a user\n>     will be forwarded to after successful authentication.\n",

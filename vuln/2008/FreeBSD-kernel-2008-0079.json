    "details": "The Opera Team reports:\n\n> Scripts are able to change the addresses of framed pages that\n> come from the same site. Due to a flaw in the way that Opera checks\n> what frames can be changed, a site can change the address of frames\n> on other sites inside any window that it has opened. This allows\n> sites to open pages from other sites, and display misleading\n> information on them.\n\n> Custom shortcut and menu commands can be used to activate external\n> applications. In some cases, the parameters passed to these\n> applications are not prepared correctly, and may be created from\n> uninitialized memory. These may be misinterpreted as additional\n> parameters, and depending on the application, this could allow\n> execution of arbitrary code.\n>\n> Successful exploitation requires convincing the user to modify\n> their shortcuts or menu files appropriately, pointing to an\n> appropriate target application, then to activate that shortcut at\n> an appropriate time. To inject code, additional means will have to\n> be employed.\n\n> When insecure pages load content from secure sites into a frame,\n> they can cause Opera to incorrectly report the insecure site as\n> being secure. The padlock icon will incorrectly be shown, and the\n> security information dialog will state that the connection is\n> secure, but without any certificate information.\n\n> As a security precaution, Opera does not allow Web pages to\n> link to files on the user's local disk. However, a flaw exists\n> that allows Web pages to link to feed source files on the\n> user's computer. Suitable detection of JavaScript events and\n> appropriate manipulation can unreliably allow a script to\n> detect the difference between successful and unsuccessful\n> subscriptions to these files, to allow it to discover if the\n> file exists or not. In most cases the attempt will fail.\n\n> It has been reported that when a user subscribes to a news\n> feed using the feed subscription button, the page address\n> can be changed. This causes the address field not to update\n> correctly. Although this can mean that misleading\n> information can be displayed in the address field, it can\n> only leave the attacking page's address in the address bar,\n> not a trusted third party address.",

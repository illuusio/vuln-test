Under certain error conditions,\nuser defined data will be copied into a stack allocated buffer\nstored in the kernel without sufficient bounds checking.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIf the system is configured to allow unprivileged users to\nmount file systems, it is possible for a local adversary to\nexploit this vulnerability and execute code in the context of\nthe kernel.\n\nWorkaround:\n===========\n\nIt is possible to work around this issue by allowing only\nprivileged users to mount file systems by running the\nfollowing sysctl(8) command:\n\n```\n# sysctl vfs.usermount=0\n```",

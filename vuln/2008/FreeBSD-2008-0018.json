While iterating through all sections contained in\n> the PE file, several attacker controlled values are extracted from the\n> file. On each iteration, arithmetic operations are performed without\n> taking into consideration 32-bit integer wrap.\n>\n> Since insufficient integer overflow checks are present, an attacker\n> can cause a heap overflow by causing a specially crafted Petite packed\n> PE binary to be scanned. This results in an exploitable memory\n> corruption condition.\n>\n> Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of\n> arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using libclamav. In\n> the case of the clamd program, this will result in code execution with\n> the privileges of the clamav user. Unsuccessful exploitation results\n> in the clamd process crashing.\n\n# Workaround\n\nDisabling the scanning of PE files will prevent exploitation.\n\nIf using clamscan, this can be done by running clamscan with the\n\\'\\--no-pe\\' option.\n\nIf using clamdscan, set the \\'ScanPE\\' option in the clamd.conf file to\n\\'no\\'.\n",

    "details": "The Opera Team reports:\n\n> Scripts are able to change the addresses of framed pages that come\n> from the same site. Due to a flaw in the way that Opera checks what\n> frames can be changed, a site can change the address of frames on\n> other sites inside any window that it has opened. This allows sites to\n> open pages from other sites, and display misleading information on\n> them.\n\n> Custom shortcut and menu commands can be used to activate external\n> applications. In some cases, the parameters passed to these\n> applications are not prepared correctly, and may be created from\n> uninitialized memory. These may be misinterpreted as additional\n> parameters, and depending on the application, this could allow\n> execution of arbitrary code.\n>\n> Successful exploitation requires convincing the user to modify their\n> shortcuts or menu files appropriately, pointing to an appropriate\n> target application, then to activate that shortcut at an appropriate\n> time. To inject code, additional means will have to be employed.\n\n> When insecure pages load content from secure sites into a frame, they\n> can cause Opera to incorrectly report the insecure site as being\n> secure. The padlock icon will incorrectly be shown, and the security\n> information dialog will state that the connection is secure, but\n> without any certificate information.\n\n> As a security precaution, Opera does not allow Web pages to link to\n> files on the user\\'s local disk. However, a flaw exists that allows\n> Web pages to link to feed source files on the user\\'s computer.\n> Suitable detection of JavaScript events and appropriate manipulation\n> can unreliably allow a script to detect the difference between\n> successful and unsuccessful subscriptions to these files, to allow it\n> to discover if the file exists or not. In most cases the attempt will\n> fail.\n\n> It has been reported that when a user subscribes to a news feed using\n> the feed subscription button, the page address can be changed. This\n> causes the address field not to update correctly. Although this can\n> mean that misleading information can be displayed in the address\n> field, it can only leave the attacking page\\'s address in the address\n> bar, not a trusted third party address.\n",

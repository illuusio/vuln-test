    "details": "Andreas Kurtz reports:\n\n> The jabber server Openfire (<= version 3.6.0a) contains several\n> serious vulnerabilities. Depending on the particular runtime\n> environment these issues can potentially even be used by an\n> attacker to execute code on operating system level.\n>\n> 1. Authentication bypass - This vulnerability provides an attacker\n>    full access to all functions in the admin webinterface without\n>    providing any user credentials. The Tomcat filter which is\n>    responsible for authentication could be completely\n>    circumvented.\n> 2. SQL injection - It is possible to pass SQL statements to the\n>    backend database through a SQL injection vulnerability. Depending\n>    on the particular runtime environment and database permissions it\n>    is even possible to write files to disk and execute code on\n>    operating system level.\n> 3. Multiple Cross-Site Scripting - Permits arbitrary insertion\n>    of HTML- and JavaScript code in login.jsp. An attacker could\n>    also manipulate a parameter to specify a destination to which a\n>    user will be forwarded to after successful authentication.",

This script, which is typically\n> located in a write-protected installation directory with\n> other Emacs program files, defines various functions to help\n> the Python process communicate with Emacs.\n>\n> The vulnerability arises because Python, by default,\n> prepends '' to the module search path, so modules are looked\n> for in the current directory. If the current directory is\n> world-writable, an attacker may insert malicious code by\n> adding a fake Python module named emacs.py into that\n> directory.",

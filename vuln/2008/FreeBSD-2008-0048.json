This can be exploited to trigger the use of\n> uninitialized memory in e.g. a free() call via unknown PNG chunks\n> having a length of zero.\n>\n> Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but\n> requires that the application calls the png_set_read_user_chunk_fn()\n> function or the png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() function under specific\n> conditions.\n",

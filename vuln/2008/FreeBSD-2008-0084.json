A successful attack requires that (a) the client has\n> agreed to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by\n> including \\\"pull\\\" or the macro \\\"client\\\" in its configuration file,\n> (b) the client succesfully authenticates the server, (c) the server is\n> malicious or has been compromised and is under the control of the\n> attacker, and (d) the client is running a non-Windows OS.\n",

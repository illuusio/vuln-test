We have hardened\n> these checks in BlogAPI module for this release, but the security team\n> would like to re-iterate that the \\'Administer content with BlogAPI\\'\n> permission should only be given to trusted users. If the core BlogAPI\n> module is not enabled, your site will not be affected.\n>\n> A weakness in the node module API allowed for node validation to be\n> bypassed in certain circumstances for contributed modules implementing\n> the API. Additional checks have been added to ensure that validation\n> is performed in all cases. This vulnerability only affects sites using\n> one of a very small number of contributed modules, all of which will\n> continue to work correctly with the improved API. None of them were\n> found vulnerable, so our correction is a preventative measure.\n",

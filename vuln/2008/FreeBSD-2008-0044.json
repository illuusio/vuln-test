This provided\n> two vulnerabilities to privilege escalation: (1) index functions were\n> executed as the superuser and not the table owner during VACUUM and\n> ANALYZE, and (2) that SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION were\n> permitted within index functions. Both of these holes have now been\n> closed.\n\n> PostgreSQL allowed malicious users to initiate a denial-of-service by\n> passing certain regular expressions in SQL queries. First, users could\n> create infinite loops using some specific regular expressions. Second,\n> certain complex regular expressions could consume excessive amounts of\n> memory. Third, out-of-range backref numbers could be used to crash the\n> backend.\n\n> DBLink functions combined with local trust or ident authentication\n> could be used by a malicious user to gain superuser privileges. This\n> issue has been fixed, and does not affect users who have not installed\n> DBLink (an optional module), or who are using password authentication\n> for local access. This same problem was addressed in the previous\n> release cycle, but that patch failed to close all forms of the\n> loophole.\n",

If successful, this could trigger execution\n> of arbitrary code within the context of the CDF-reading program\n> that could be exploited to compromise a system, or otherwise\n> crash the program. While it's unlikely that you would open CDFs\n> from untrusted sources, we recommend everyone upgrade to the\n> latest CDF libraries on their systems, including the IDL and\n> Matlab plugins. Most worrisome is any service that enables the\n> general public to submit CDF files for processing.\n>\n> The vulnerability is in the CDF library routines not properly\n> checking the length tags on a CDF file before copying data to a\n> stack buffer. Exploitation requires the user to explicitly open\n> a specially-crafted file. CDF users should not open files from\n> untrusted third parties until the patch is applied (and continue\n> then to exercise normal caution for files from untrusted third\n> parties).",

These requests are used to transfer arbitrary amounts of\n> memory from clients to servers and back using small SMB requests and\n> contain two offsets: One offset (A) pointing into the PDU sent by the\n> client and one (B) to direct the transferred contents into the buffer\n> built on the server side. While the range checking for offset (B) is\n> correct, a cut and paste error lets offset (A) pass completely\n> unchecked against overflow.\n>\n> The buffers passed into trans, trans2 and nttrans undergo higher-level\n> processing like DCE/RPC requests or listing directories. The missing\n> bounds check means that a malicious client can make the server do this\n> higher-level processing on arbitrary memory contents of the smbd\n> process handling the request. It is unknown if that can be abused to\n> pass arbitrary memory contents back to the client, but an important\n> barrier is missing from the affected Samba versions.\n",

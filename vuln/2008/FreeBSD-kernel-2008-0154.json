While iterating through\n> all sections contained in the PE file, several attacker\n> controlled values are extracted from the file. On each iteration,\n> arithmetic operations are performed without taking into\n> consideration 32-bit integer wrap.\n>\n> Since insufficient integer overflow checks are present,\n> an attacker can cause a heap overflow by causing a specially\n> crafted Petite packed PE binary to be scanned. This results\n> in an exploitable memory corruption condition.\n>\n> Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the\n> execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process\n> using libclamav. In the case of the clamd program, this will\n> result in code execution with the privileges of the clamav user.\n> Unsuccessful exploitation results in the clamd process crashing.\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nDisabling the scanning of PE files will prevent exploitation.\n\nIf using clamscan, this can be done by running clamscan with the\n'--no-pe' option.\n\nIf using clamdscan, set the 'ScanPE' option in the clamd.conf\nfile to 'no'.",

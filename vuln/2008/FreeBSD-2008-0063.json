Otherwise, a specific scenario could result in\n> every spamdyke installation being used as an open relay. If the remote\n> server connects and gives one or more recipients that are rejected\n> (for relaying or blacklisting), then gives the DATA command, spamdyke\n> will ignore all other commands, assuming that message data is being\n> transmitted. However, because all of the recipients were rejected,\n> qmail will reject the DATA command. From that point on, the remote\n> server can give as many recipients as it likes and spamdyke will\n> ignore them all \\-- they will not be filtered at all. After that, the\n> remote server can give the DATA command and send the actual message\n> data. Because spamdyke is controlling relaying, the RELAYCLIENT\n> environment variable is set and qmail won\\'t check for relaying\n> either. Thanks to Mirko Buffoni for reporting this one.\n",

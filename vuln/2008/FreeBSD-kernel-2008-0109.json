Otherwise, a specific scenario could\n> result in every spamdyke installation being used as an open relay.\n> If the remote server connects and gives one or more recipients that\n> are rejected (for relaying or blacklisting), then gives the DATA\n> command, spamdyke will ignore all other commands, assuming that\n> message data is being transmitted. However, because all of the\n> recipients were rejected, qmail will reject the DATA command. From\n> that point on, the remote server can give as many recipients as it\n> likes and spamdyke will ignore them all -- they will not be filtered\n> at all. After that, the remote server can give the DATA command and\n> send the actual message data. Because spamdyke is controlling\n> relaying, the RELAYCLIENT environment variable is set and qmail won't\n> check for relaying either. Thanks to Mirko Buffoni for reporting\n> this one.",

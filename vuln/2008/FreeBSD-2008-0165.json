To inject code, additional\n> techniques will have to be employed.\n>\n> Exceptionally long host names in file: URLs can cause a buffer\n> overflow, which may be exploited to execute arbitrary code. Remote Web\n> pages cannot refer to file: URLs, so successful exploitation involves\n> tricking users into manually opening the exploit URL, or a local file\n> that refers to it.\n>\n> When Opera is previewing a news feed, some scripted URLs are not\n> correctly blocked. These can execute scripts which are able to\n> subscribe the user to any feed URL that the attacker chooses, and can\n> also view the contents of any feeds that the user is subscribed to.\n> These may contain sensitive information.\n>\n> Built-in XSLT templates incorrectly handle escaped content and can\n> cause it to be treated as markup. If a site accepts content from\n> untrusted users, which it then displays using XSLT as escaped strings,\n> this can allow scripted markup to be injected. The scripts will then\n> be executed in the security context of that site.\n",

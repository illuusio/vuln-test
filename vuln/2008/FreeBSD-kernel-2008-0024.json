These requests are used to transfer arbitrary amounts\n> of memory from clients to servers and back using small SMB\n> requests and contain two offsets: One offset (A) pointing into\n> the PDU sent by the client and one (B) to direct the transferred\n> contents into the buffer built on the server side. While the range\n> checking for offset (B) is correct, a cut and paste error lets offset\n> (A) pass completely unchecked against overflow.\n>\n> The buffers passed into trans, trans2 and nttrans undergo higher-level\n> processing like DCE/RPC requests or listing directories. The missing\n> bounds check means that a malicious client can make the server do this\n> higher-level processing on arbitrary memory contents of the smbd process\n> handling the request. It is unknown if that can be abused to pass arbitrary\n> memory contents back to the client, but an important barrier is missing from\n> the affected Samba versions.",

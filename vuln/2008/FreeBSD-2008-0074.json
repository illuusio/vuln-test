The attacker can use this attack to gain access\nto sensitive information. Functions utilizing `expand_filepath()` may be\naffected.\n\nIt should be noted that this vulnerability is not considered to be\nserious by the FreeBSD Security Team, since `safe_mode` and\n`open_basedir` are insecure by design and should not be relied upon.\n",

This script, which is typically located in a\n> write-protected installation directory with other Emacs program files,\n> defines various functions to help the Python process communicate with\n> Emacs.\n>\n> The vulnerability arises because Python, by default, prepends \\'\\' to\n> the module search path, so modules are looked for in the current\n> directory. If the current directory is world-writable, an attacker may\n> insert malicious code by adding a fake Python module named emacs.py\n> into that directory.\n",

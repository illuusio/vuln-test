This can be exploited to trigger the\n> use of uninitialized memory in e.g. a free() call via unknown PNG\n> chunks having a length of zero.\n>\n> Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but\n> requires that the application calls the png\\_set\\_read\\_user\\_chunk\\_fn()\n> function or the png\\_set\\_keep\\_unknown\\_chunks() function under\n> specific conditions.",

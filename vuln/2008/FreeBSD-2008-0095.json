Under certain error conditions, user defined data will be copied\ninto a stack allocated buffer stored in the kernel without sufficient\nbounds checking.\n\n# Impact:\n\nIf the system is configured to allow unprivileged users to mount file\nsystems, it is possible for a local adversary to exploit this\nvulnerability and execute code in the context of the kernel.\n\n# Workaround:\n\nIt is possible to work around this issue by allowing only privileged\nusers to mount file systems by running the following sysctl(8) command:\n\n    # sysctl vfs.usermount=0\n",

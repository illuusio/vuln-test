Both of these holes have now\n> been closed.\n\n> PostgreSQL allowed malicious users to initiate a denial-of-service\n> by passing certain regular expressions in SQL queries. First, users\n> could create infinite loops using some specific regular expressions.\n> Second, certain complex regular expressions could consume excessive\n> amounts of memory. Third, out-of-range backref numbers could be used\n> to crash the backend.\n\n> DBLink functions combined with local trust or ident authentication\n> could be used by a malicious user to gain superuser privileges. This\n> issue has been fixed, and does not affect users who have not\n> installed DBLink (an optional module), or who are using password\n> authentication for local access. This same problem was addressed in\n> the previous release cycle, but that patch failed to close all forms\n> of the loophole.",

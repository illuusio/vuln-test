Some values from OpenID providers are output without being\n> properly escaped, allowing malicious providers to insert arbitrary\n> script and HTML code (XSS) into user pages. This issue affects Drupal\n> 6.x only. filter_xss_admin() has been hardened to prevent use of the\n> object HTML tag in administrator input.\n>\n> Translated strings (5.x, 6.x) and OpenID identities (6.x) are\n> immediately deleted upon accessing a properly formatted URL, making\n> such deletion vulnerable to cross site request forgeries (CSRF). This\n> may lead to unintended deletion of translated strings or OpenID\n> identities when a sufficiently privileged user visits a page or site\n> created by a malicious person.\n>\n> When contributed modules such as Workflow NG terminate the current\n> request during a login event, user module is not able to regenerate\n> the user\\'s session. This may lead to a session fixation attack, when\n> a malicious user is able to control another users\\' initial session\n> ID. As the session is not regenerated, the malicious user may use the\n> \\'fixed\\' session ID after the victim authenticates and will have the\n> same access.

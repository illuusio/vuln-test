This can be used to execute scripts in the context of an\n> unrelated frame, which allows cross-site scripting.\n\n> When Opera is previewing a news feed, some scripts are not correctly\n> blocked. These scripts are able to subscribe the user to any feed URL\n> that the attacker chooses, and can also view the contents of any feeds\n> that the user is subscribed to.

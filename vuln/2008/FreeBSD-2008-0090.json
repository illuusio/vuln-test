If successful, this could trigger execution of arbitrary code\n> within the context of the CDF-reading program that could be exploited\n> to compromise a system, or otherwise crash the program. While it\\'s\n> unlikely that you would open CDFs from untrusted sources, we recommend\n> everyone upgrade to the latest CDF libraries on their systems,\n> including the IDL and Matlab plugins. Most worrisome is any service\n> that enables the general public to submit CDF files for processing.\n>\n> The vulnerability is in the CDF library routines not properly checking\n> the length tags on a CDF file before copying data to a stack buffer.\n> Exploitation requires the user to explicitly open a specially-crafted\n> file. CDF users should not open files from untrusted third parties\n> until the patch is applied (and continue then to exercise normal\n> caution for files from untrusted third parties).\n",

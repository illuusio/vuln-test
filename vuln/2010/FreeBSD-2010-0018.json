Unlike a regular command, pseudo-commands\n> do not begin with a slash (\\'/\\'). The flaw is that sudo\\'s the\n> matching code would only check against the list of pseudo-commands if\n> the user-specified command also contained no slashes. As a result, if\n> the user ran \\\"sudo ./sudoedit\\\" the normal matching code path was\n> followed, which uses stat(2) to verify that the user-specified command\n> matches the one in sudoers. In this case, it would compare the\n> \\\"./sudoedit\\\" specified by the user with \\\"sudoedit\\\" from the\n> sudoers file, resulting in a positive match.\n",

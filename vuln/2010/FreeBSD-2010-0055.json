When Sudo\n> runs a bash script, it is this second PATH variable that is used by\n> bash, regardless of whether or not Sudo has overwritten the first\n> instance of PATH. This may allow an attacker to subvert the program\n> being run under Sudo and execute commands he/she would not otherwise\n> be allowed to run.\n",

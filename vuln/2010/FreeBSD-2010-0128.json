When reading user input if a TELNET_IAC escape\n> sequence is encountered the process miscalculates a buffer length\n> counter value allowing a user controlled copy of data to a stack\n> buffer. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute\n> arbitrary code under the context of the proftpd process.\n",

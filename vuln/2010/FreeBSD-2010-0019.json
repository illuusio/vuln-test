An\n> attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal site\n> to send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL. No user submitted\n> data will be sent to that URL.\n>\n> Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the\n> display of language codes, native and English language names properly.\n> While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary\n> administrator input is allowed. This vulnerability is mitigated by the\n> fact that the attacker must have a role with the \\'administer\n> languages\\' permission.\n>\n> Under certain circumstances, a user with an open session that is\n> blocked can maintain his/her session on the Drupal site, despite being\n> blocked.\n",

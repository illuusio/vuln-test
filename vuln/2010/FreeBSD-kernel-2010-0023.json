To exploit this vulnerability the malicious user\n>   needs to send extremely large HTML emails to your\n>   system address.\n\n> AgentTicketZoom is vulnerable to XSS attacks from HTML e-mails:\n>\n> Whenever a customer sends an HTML e-mail and RichText is enabled\n> in OTRS, javascript contained in the email can do everything\n> in the OTRS agent interface that the agent himself could do.\n>\n> Most relevant is that this type of exploit can be used in such\n> a way that the agent won't even detect he is being exploited.",

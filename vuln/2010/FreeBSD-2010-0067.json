However, any user was able, by crafting\n>   their own search URL, to search for bugs based using those fields as\n>   criteria, thus possibly exposing sensitive time-tracking information\n>   by a user seeing that a bug matched their search.\n> - If \\$use_suexec was set to \\\"1\\\" in the localconfig file, then the\n>   localconfig file\\'s permissions were set as world-readable by\n>   checksetup.pl. This allowed any user with local shell access to see\n>   the contents of the file, including the database password and the\n>   site_wide_secret variable used for CSRF protection.\n",

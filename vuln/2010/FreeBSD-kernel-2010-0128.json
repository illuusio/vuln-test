Unlike a regular command,\n> pseudo-commands do not begin with a slash ('/'). The flaw is that\n> sudo's the matching code would only check against the list of\n> pseudo-commands if the user-specified command also contained no\n> slashes. As a result, if the user ran \"sudo ./sudoedit\" the normal\n> matching code path was followed, which uses stat(2) to verify that\n> the user-specified command matches the one in sudoers. In this\n> case, it would compare the \"./sudoedit\" specified by the user with\n> \"sudoedit\" from the sudoers file, resulting in a positive\n> match.",

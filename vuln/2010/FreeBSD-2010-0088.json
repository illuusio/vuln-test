But boolean charts\n>   let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly disclosing group\n>   membership. This security fix restricts the use of pronouns to\n>   groups the user belongs to.\n> - Notification Bypass: Normally, when a user is impersonated, he\n>   receives an email informing him that he is being impersonated,\n>   containing the identity of the impersonator. However, it was\n>   possible to impersonate a user without this notification being sent.\n> - Remote Information Disclosure: An error message thrown by the\n>   \\\"Reports\\\" and \\\"Duplicates\\\" page confirmed the non-existence of\n>   products, thus allowing users to guess confidential product names.\n>   (Note that the \\\"Duplicates\\\" page was not vulnerable in Bugzilla\n>   3.6rc1 and above though.)\n> - Denial of Service: If a comment contained the phrases \\\"bug X\\\" or\n>   \\\"attachment X\\\", where X was an integer larger than the maximum\n>   32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would throw an error, and any\n>   page containing that comment would not be viewable. On most\n>   Bugzillas, any user can enter a comment on any bug, so any user\n>   could have used this to deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas\n>   running on databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.\n",

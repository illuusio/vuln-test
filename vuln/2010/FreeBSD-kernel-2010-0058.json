But boolean charts\n>   let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly\n>   disclosing group membership. This security fix\n>   restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user\n>   belongs to.\n> * Notification Bypass:\n>   Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives\n>   an email informing him that he is being impersonated,\n>   containing the identity of the impersonator. However,\n>   it was possible to impersonate a user without this\n>   notification being sent.\n> * Remote Information Disclosure:\n>   An error message thrown by the \"Reports\" and \"Duplicates\"\n>   page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus\n>   allowing users to guess confidential product names.\n>   (Note that the \"Duplicates\" page was not vulnerable\n>   in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.)\n> * Denial of Service:\n>   If a comment contained the phrases \"bug X\" or\n>   \"attachment X\", where X was an integer larger than the\n>   maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would\n>   throw an error, and any page containing that comment would\n>   not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter\n>   a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to\n>   deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on\n>   databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.",

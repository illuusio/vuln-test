A maliciously crafted Host header could inject additional\n> headers or entire requests. The HTTP/1 client now refuses to send\n> requests containing an invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.\n\n> cmd/go: cgo code injection\n>\n> The go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using\n> cgo. This may result in unexpected behavior when running a go program\n> which uses cgo.\n\n> runtime: unexpected behavior of setuid/setgid binaries\n>\n> The Go runtime didn\\'t act any differently when a binary had the\n> setuid/setgid bit set. On Unix platforms, if a setuid/setgid binary\n> was executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any\n> files could result in unexpected content being read/written with\n> elevated prilieges. Similarly if a setuid/setgid program was\n> terminated, either via panic or signal, it could leak the contents of\n> its registers.\n\n> cmd/go: improper sanitization of LDFLAGS\n>\n> The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using\n> cgo. This may occur when running \\\"go get\\\" on a malicious module, or\n> when running any other command which builds untrusted code. This is\n> can by triggered by linker flags, specified via a \\\"#cgo LDFLAGS\\\"\n> directive.\n\n> html/template: improper sanitization of CSS values\n>\n> Angle brackets (\\<\\>) were not considered dangerous characters when\n> inserted into CSS contexts. Templates containing multiple actions\n> separated by a \\'/\\' character could result in unexpectedly closing\n> the CSS context and allowing for injection of unexpected HMTL, if\n> executed with untrusted input.\n\n> html/template: improper handling of JavaScript whitespace\n>\n> Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters were considered to be\n> whitespace. Templates containing whitespace characters outside of the\n> character set \\\"\\\\t\\\\n\\\\f\\\\r\\\\u0020\\\\u2028\\\\u2029\\\" in JavaScript\n> contexts that also contain actions may not be properly sanitized\n> during execution.\n\n> html/template: improper handling of empty HTML attributes\n>\n> Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g.\n> \\\"attr={{.}}\\\") executed with empty input could result in output that\n> would have unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization\n> rules. This may allow injection of arbitrary attributes into tags.\n",

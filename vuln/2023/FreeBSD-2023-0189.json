Instead they trusted that they were\n>   called with values provided by an Xserver that was adhering to the\n>   bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by\n>   X.Org do.\n>\n>   As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an\n>   out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious\n>   proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the\n>   Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display\n>   structure itself. Testing has found it is possible to at least cause\n>   the client to crash with this memory corruption.\n",

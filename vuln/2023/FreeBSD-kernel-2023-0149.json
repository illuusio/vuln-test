If the user tries to initialize multiple providers at once,\nfor the second and subsequent devices the standard input stream will be\nalready empty. In this case, GELI silently uses a NULL key as the user\nkey file. If the user used only a key file without a user passphrase,\nthe master key was encrypted with an empty key file. This might not be\nnoticed if the devices were also decrypted in a batch operation.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nSome GELI providers might be silently encrypted with a NULL key\nfile.",

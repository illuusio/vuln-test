That is, a packet with multiple fragment extension headers\nwould not be recognized as the correct ultimate payload. Instead a\npacket with multiple IPv6 fragment headers would unexpectedly be\ninterpreted as a fragmented packet, rather than as whatever the real\npayload is.\n\n# Impact:\n\nIPv6 fragments may bypass firewall rules written on the assumption all\nfragments have been reassembled and, as a result, be forwarded or\nprocessed by the host.\n",

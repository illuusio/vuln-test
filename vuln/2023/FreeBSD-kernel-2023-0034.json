    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nAs part of its stateful TCP connection tracking implementation,\npf performs sequence number validation on inbound packets. This\nmakes it difficult for a would-be attacker to spoof the sender and\ninject packets into a TCP stream, since crafted packets must contain\nsequence numbers which match the current connection state to avoid\nbeing rejected by the firewall.\n\nA bug in the implementation of sequence number validation means\nthat the sequence number is not in fact validated, allowing an\nattacker who is able to impersonate the remote host and guess the\nconnection's port numbers to inject packets into the TCP stream.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nAn attacker can, with relatively little effort, inject packets\ninto a TCP stream destined to a host behind a pf firewall. This\ncould be used to implement a denial-of-service attack for hosts\nbehind the firewall, for example by sending TCP RST packets to the\nhost.",

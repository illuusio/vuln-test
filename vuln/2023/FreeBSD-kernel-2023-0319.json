The number of\n>     acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression\n>     chain\" was capped, but the cap was implemented on a\n>     per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a\n>     virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply\n>     by using many headers. The use of such a decompression\n>     chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", making\n>     curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap\n>     memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.",

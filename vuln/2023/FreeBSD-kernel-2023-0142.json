These shared libraries may have\nside effects that occur on load and unload (dlopen and dlclose).\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nAn attacker with access to a server that accepts a forwarded\nssh-agent connection may be able to execute code on the machine running\nssh-agent. Note that the attack relies on properties of operating\nsystem-provided libraries. This has been demonstrated on other\noperating systems; it is unknown whether this attack is possible using\nthe libraries provided by a FreeBSD installation.",

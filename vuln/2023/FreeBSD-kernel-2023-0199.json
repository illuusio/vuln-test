Instead they trusted that they were called\n>   with values provided by an Xserver that was adhering to the bounds\n>   specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do.\n>\n>   As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an\n>   out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious\n>   proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display\n>   structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure\n>   itself. Testing has found it is possible to at least cause the client\n>   to crash with this memory corruption.",

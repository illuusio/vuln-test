    "details": "Harry Sintonen reports:\n\n> \n>\n> CVE-2023-27533\n> :   curl supports communicating using the TELNET protocol and as a\n>     part of this it offers users to pass on user name and \\\"telnet\n>     options\\\" for the server negotiation. Due to lack of proper input\n>     scrubbing and without it being the documented functionality, curl\n>     would pass on user name and telnet options to the server as\n>     provided. This could allow users to pass in carefully crafted\n>     content that pass on content or do option negotiation without the\n>     application intending to do so. In particular if an application\n>     for example allows users to provide the data or parts of the data.\n>\n> CVE-2023-27534\n> :   curl supports SFTP transfers. curl\\'s SFTP implementation offers a\n>     special feature in the path component of URLs: a tilde (\\~)\n>     character as the first path element in the path to denotes a path\n>     relative to the user\\'s home directory. This is supported because\n>     of wording in the once proposed to-become RFC draft that was to\n>     dictate how SFTP URLs work. Due to a bug, the handling of the\n>     tilde in SFTP path did however not only replace it when it is used\n>     stand-alone as the first path element but also wrongly when used\n>     as a mere prefix in the first element. Using a path like /\\~2/foo\n>     when accessing a server using the user dan (with home directory\n>     /home/dan) would then quite surprisingly access the file\n>     /home/dan2/foo. This can be taken advantage of to circumvent\n>     filtering or worse.\n>\n> CVE-2023-27535\n> :   libcurl would reuse a previously created FTP connection even when\n>     one or more options had been changed that could have made the\n>     effective user a very different one, thus leading to the doing the\n>     second transfer with wrong credentials. libcurl keeps previously\n>     used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to\n>     reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, several FTP\n>     settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making\n>     them match too easily. The settings in questions are\n>     CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,\n>     CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC and CURLOPT_USE_SSL level.\n>\n> CVE-2023-27536\n> :   ibcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the\n>     GSS delegation (CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION) option had been changed\n>     that could have changed the user\\'s permissions in a second\n>     transfer. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a\n>     connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them\n>     matches the setup. However, this GSS delegation setting was left\n>     out from the configuration match checks, making them match too\n>     easily, affecting krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.\n>\n> CVE-2023-27537\n> :   libcurl supports sharing HSTS data between separate \\\"handles\\\".\n>     This sharing was introduced without considerations for do this\n>     sharing across separate threads but there was no indication of\n>     this fact in the documentation. Due to missing mutexes or thread\n>     locks, two threads sharing the same HSTS data could end up doing a\n>     double-free or use-after-free.\n>\n> CVE-2023-27538\n> :   libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when an\n>     SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited\n>     reuse. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection\n>     pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the\n>     setup. However, two SSH settings were left out from the\n>     configuration match checks, making them match too easily.\n",

We therefore advise all\n> users of Routinator to upgrade to this release at their earliest\n> convenience.\n>\n> The first issue, CVE-2022-39915, can lead to Routinator crashing when\n> trying to decode certain illegal RPKI objects.\n>\n> The second issue, CVE-2022-39916, only affects users that have the\n> rrdp-keep-responses option enabled which allows storing all received\n> RRDP responses on disk. Because the file name for these responses is\n> derived from the URI and the path wasn\\'t checked properly, a RRDP URI\n> could be constructed that results in the response stored outside the\n> directory, possibly overwriting existing files.\n",

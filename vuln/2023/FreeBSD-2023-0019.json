When using the default\n> configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs git\n> commands in order to display information about the current repository\n> in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their\n> current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a\n> shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary\n> commands under the attacker\\'s control. This problem has been fixed in\n> fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including\n> using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this\n> issue. As a workaround, remove the fish_git_prompt function from the\n> prompt.\n",

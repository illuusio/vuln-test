When curl is asked to pass along the hostname to the SOCKS5\n> proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done\n> by curl itself, the maximum length that hostname can be is 255 bytes.\n> If the hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl switches\n> to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address\n> only to the proxy. Due to a bug, the local variable that means \\\"let\n> the host resolve the name\\\" could get the wrong value during a slow\n> SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long\n> hostname to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved\n> address there.\n",

The vulnerability\n> allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process.\n> On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an\n> out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no\n> denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode.\n> This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised\n> to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",

    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\npam\\_krb5 authenticates the user by essentially running kinit(1) with\nthe password, getting a `ticket-granting ticket' (tgt) from the Kerberos\nKDC (Key Distribution Center) over the network, as a way to verify the\npassword.\n\nNormally, the system running the pam\\_krb5 module will also have a\nkeytab, a key provisioned by the KDC. The pam\\_krb5 module will use the\ntgt to get a service ticket and validate it against the keytab, ensuring\nthe tgt is valid and therefore, the password is valid.\n\nHowever, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam\\_krb5 has\nno way to validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the\ntgt provided over the network as being valid.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIn a non-default FreeBSD installation that leverages pam\\_krb5 for\nauthentication and does not have a keytab provisioned, an attacker that\nis able to control both the password and the KDC responses can return a\nvalid tgt, allowing authentication to occur for any user on the\nsystem.",

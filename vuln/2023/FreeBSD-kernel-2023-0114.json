That\nis, a packet with multiple fragment extension headers would not be recognized\nas the correct ultimate payload. Instead a packet with multiple IPv6 fragment\nheaders would unexpectedly be interpreted as a fragmented packet, rather than\nas whatever the real payload is.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIPv6 fragments may bypass firewall rules written on the assumption all\nfragments have been reassembled and, as a result, be forwarded or processed\nby the host.",

When\n>   a logical device switch happens (e.g. moving from a touchpad to a\n>   mouse), the server re-calculates the information available on the\n>   respective master device (typically the Virtual Core Pointer).

As a result, querying or changing the XKB button\n>   actions results in out-of-bounds memory reads and writes.\n>\n>   This may lead to local privilege escalation if the server is run as\n>   root or remote code execution (e.g. x11 over ssh).\n>\n> - CVE-2023-6478/ZDI-CAN-22561: X.Org server: Out-of-bounds memory read\n>   in RRChangeOutputProperty and RRChangeProviderProperty\n>\n>   This fixes an OOB read and the resulting information disclosure.\n>\n>   Length calculation for the request was clipped to a 32-bit integer.\n>   With the correct stuff-\\>nUnits value the expected request size was\n>   truncated, passing the REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE check.\n>\n>   The server then proceeded with reading at least stuff-\\>nUnits bytes\n>   (depending on stuff-\\>format) from the request and stuffing whatever\n>   it finds into the property. In the process it would also allocate at\n>   least stuff-\\>nUnits bytes, i.e. 4GB.\n",

This would result in\nbuffered unicast traffic being exposed to any stations with access to the\nmulticast key.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nAs described in the \"Framing Frames: Bypassing Wi-Fi Encryption by\nManipulating Transmit Queues\" paper, an attacker can induce an access point\nto buffer frames for a client, deauthenticate the client (causing the unicast\nkey to be removed from the access point), and subsequent flushing of the\nbuffered frames now encrypted with the multicast key. This would give the\nattacker access to the data.",

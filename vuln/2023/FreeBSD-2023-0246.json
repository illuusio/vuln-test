These shared libraries may have side\neffects that occur on load and unload (dlopen and dlclose).\n\n# Impact:\n\nAn attacker with access to a server that accepts a forwarded ssh-agent\nconnection may be able to execute code on the machine running ssh-agent.\nNote that the attack relies on properties of operating system-provided\nlibraries. This has been demonstrated on other operating systems; it is\nunknown whether this attack is possible using the libraries provided by\na FreeBSD installation.\n",

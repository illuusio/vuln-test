    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nCasper services allow limiting operations that a process can\nperform. Each service maintains a specific list of permitted\noperations. Certain operations can be further restricted, such as\nspecifying which domain names can be resolved. During the verification\nof limits, the service must ensure that the new set of constraints\nis a subset of the previous one. In the case of the cap\\_net service,\nthe currently limited set of domain names was fetched incorrectly.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIn certain scenarios, if only a list of resolvable domain names\nwas specified without setting any other limitations, the application\ncould submit a new list of domains including include entries not\npreviously in the list.",

    "details": "The OpenSSL project reports:\n\n> X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName (CVE-2023-0286)\n> (High): There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400\n> address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were\n> parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for\n> GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field\n> as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL\n> function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.\n>\n> Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption (CVE-2022-4304) (Moderate): A timing\n> based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation\n> which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a\n> Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an\n> attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial\n> messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding\n> modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.\n>\n> X.509 Name Constraints Read Buffer Overflow (CVE-2022-4203)\n> (Moderate): A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509\n> certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking.\n> Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification\n> and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or\n> for the application to continue certificate verification despite\n> failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.\n>\n> Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF (CVE-2023-0215) (Moderate): The\n> public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for\n> streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to\n> OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities,\n> but may also be called directly by end user applications.\n>\n> Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex (CVE-2022-4450) (Moderate):\n> The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses\n> and decodes the \\\"name\\\" (e.g. \\\"CERTIFICATE\\\"), any header data and\n> the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \\\"name_out\\\",\n> \\\"header\\\" and \\\"data\\\" arguments are populated with pointers to\n> buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is\n> responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a\n> PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case\n> PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the\n> header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been\n> freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will\n> occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited\n> by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for\n> parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.\n>\n> Invalid pointer dereference in d2i_PKCS7 functions (CVE-2023-0216)\n> (Moderate): An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered\n> when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the\n> d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions.\n>\n> NULL dereference validating DSA public key (CVE-2023-0217) (Moderate):\n> An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an\n> application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the\n> EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an\n> application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied\n> from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial\n> of service attack.\n>\n> NULL dereference during PKCS7 data verification (CVE-2023-0401)\n> (Moderate): A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are\n> being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the\n> hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library\n> but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the\n> digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the\n> return value from the initialization function which later leads to\n> invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.\n",

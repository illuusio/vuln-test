When a logical device switch happens (e.g. moving\n>   from a touchpad to a mouse), the server re-calculates the\n>   information available on the respective master device\n>   (typically the Virtual Core Pointer). This re-calculation\n>   only allocated enough memory for a single XKB action\n>   rather instead of enough for the newly active physical\n>   device's number of button. As a result, querying or\n>   changing the XKB button actions results in out-of-bounds\n>   memory reads and writes.\n>\n>   This may lead to local privilege escalation if the server is run as root or\n>   remote code execution (e.g. x11 over ssh).\n> * CVE-2023-6478/ZDI-CAN-22561: X.Org server:\n>   Out-of-bounds memory read in RRChangeOutputProperty and\n>   RRChangeProviderProperty\n>\n>   This fixes an OOB read and the resulting information disclosure.\n>\n>   Length calculation for the request was clipped to a 32-bit integer. With\n>   the correct stuff->nUnits value the expected request size was\n>   truncated, passing the REQUEST\\_FIXED\\_SIZE check.\n>\n>   The server then proceeded with reading at least stuff->nUnits bytes\n>   (depending on stuff->format) from the request and stuffing whatever it\n>   finds into the property. In the process it would also allocate at least\n>   stuff->nUnits bytes, i.e. 4GB.",

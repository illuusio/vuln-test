The pam_krb5 module will use the\ntgt to get a service ticket and validate it against the keytab, ensuring\nthe tgt is valid and therefore, the password is valid.\n\nHowever, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam_krb5 has no\nway to validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the\ntgt provided over the network as being valid.\n\n# Impact:\n\nIn a non-default FreeBSD installation that leverages pam_krb5 for\nauthentication and does not have a keytab provisioned, an attacker that\nis able to control both the password and the KDC responses can return a\nvalid tgt, allowing authentication to occur for any user on the system.\n",

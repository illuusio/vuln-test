If the\n> hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl\n> switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the\n> resolved address only to the proxy. Due to a bug, the\n> local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\"\n> could get the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake,\n> and contrary to the intention, copy the too long hostname\n> to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved\n> address there.",

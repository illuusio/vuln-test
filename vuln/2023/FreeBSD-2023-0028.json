There\n> are no indications that this exploit could be used from a remote\n> machine.\n>\n> Plex Media Server versions 1.25.0.5282 and newer are not subject to\n> this vulnerability, and feature additional hardening to prevent\n> similar issues from occurring in the future. Users running older\n> server versions are encouraged to update their Plex Media Server\n> installations.\n",

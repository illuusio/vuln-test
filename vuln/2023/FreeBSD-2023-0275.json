This would result in\nbuffered unicast traffic being exposed to any stations with access to\nthe multicast key.\n\n# Impact:\n\nAs described in the \\\"Framing Frames: Bypassing Wi-Fi Encryption by\nManipulating Transmit Queues\\\" paper, an attacker can induce an access\npoint to buffer frames for a client, deauthenticate the client (causing\nthe unicast key to be removed from the access point), and subsequent\nflushing of the buffered frames now encrypted with the multicast key.\nThis would give the attacker access to the data.\n",

The reason for this confusion is the modified sequence\n> from TLS 1.2 when the session ids would provided only during the\n> TLS handshake, while in TLS 1.3 it happens post hand-shake and\n> the code was not updated to take that changed behavior into account.\n>\n> When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use\n> the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent\n> the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be\n> possible to perform unnoticed.\n>\n> This flaw can allow a malicious HTTPS proxy to MITM the traffic.\n> Such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that\n> curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work -\n> unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.",

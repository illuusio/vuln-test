This means all pages in Grafana\n>   would be open for the attack.\n> - The link is to an unauthenticated page. The following pages are\n>   vulnerable:\n>   - `/dashboard-solo/snapshot/*`\n>   - `/dashboard/snapshot/*`\n>   - `/invite/:code`\n>\n> The url has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and contain\n> the interpolation binding for AngularJS expressions. AngularJS uses\n> double curly braces for interpolation binding: `{{ }}`\n>\n> An example of an expression would be:\n> `{{constructor.constructor(\u2018alert(1)\u2019)()}}`. This can be included in\n> the link URL like this:\n>\n> <https://play.grafana.org/dashboard/snapshot/%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor('alert(1)')()%7D%7D?orgId=1>\n>\n> When the user follows the link and the page renders, the login button\n> will contain the original link with a query parameter to force a\n> redirect to the login page. The URL is not validated, and the\n> AngularJS rendering engine will execute the JavaScript expression\n> contained in the URL.\n",

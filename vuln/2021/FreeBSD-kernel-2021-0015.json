That function may\n> return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for\n> example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by\n> OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL\\_connect() or\n> SSL\\_do\\_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to\n> SSL\\_get\\_error() to return the value SSL\\_ERROR\\_WANT\\_RETRY\\_VERIFY.\n> This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the\n> application has previously called SSL\\_CTX\\_set\\_cert\\_verify\\_callback().\n> Since most applications do not do this the\n> SSL\\_ERROR\\_WANT\\_RETRY\\_VERIFY return value from SSL\\_get\\_error() will be\n> totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a\n> result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it\n> could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect\n> responses.",

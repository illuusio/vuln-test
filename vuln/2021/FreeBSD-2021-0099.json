    "details": "The Apache Maven project reports:\n\n> We received a report from Jonathan Leitschuh about a vulnerability of\n> custom repositories in dependency POMs. We\\'ve split this up into\n> three separate issues:\n>\n> - Possible Man-In-The-Middle-Attack due to custom repositories using\n>   HTTP. More and more repositories use HTTPS nowadays, but this\n>   hasn\\'t always been the case. This means that Maven Central contains\n>   POMs with custom repositories that refer to a URL over HTTP. This\n>   makes downloads via such repository a target for a MITM attack. At\n>   the same time, developers are probably not aware that for some\n>   downloads an insecure URL is being used. Because uploaded POMs to\n>   Maven Central are immutable, a change for Maven was required. To\n>   solve this, we extended the mirror configuration with blocked\n>   parameter, and we added a new external:http:\\* mirror selector (like\n>   existing external:\\*), meaning \\\"any external URL using HTTP\\\". The\n>   decision was made to block such external HTTP repositories by\n>   default: this is done by providing a mirror in the conf/settings.xml\n>   blocking insecure HTTP external URLs.\n> - Possible Domain Hijacking due to custom repositories using abandoned\n>   domains Sonatype has analyzed which domains were abandoned and has\n>   claimed these domains.\n> - Possible hijacking of downloads by redirecting to custom\n>   repositories This one was the hardest to analyze and explain. The\n>   short story is: you\\'re safe, dependencies are only downloaded from\n>   repositories within their context. So there are two main questions:\n>   what is the context and what is the order? The order is described on\n>   the Repository Order page. The first group of repositories are\n>   defined in the settings.xml (both user and global). The second group\n>   of repositories are based on inheritence, with ultimately the super\n>   POM containing the URL to Maven Central. The third group is the most\n>   complex one but is important to understand the term context:\n>   repositories from the effective POMs from the dependency path to the\n>   artifact. So if a dependency was defined by another dependency or by\n>   a Maven project, it will also include their repositories. In the end\n>   this is not a bug, but a design feature.\n",

In particular,\ntmpfs(5), smbfs(5), autofs(5) and mqueuefs(5) were failing to do so.\nAs a result, eight uninitialized kernel stack bytes may be leaked to\nuserspace by these file systems. This problem is not present in\nFreeBSD 11.\n\nAdditionally, msdosfs(5) was failing to zero-fill a pair of padding\nfields in the dirent structure, resulting in a leak of three\nuninitialized bytes.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nKernel stack disclosures may leak sensitive information which could\nbe used to compromise the security of the system.",

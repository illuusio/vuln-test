An attacker could use a path\n> traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories\n> configured by Alias-like directives.\n>\n> If files outside of these directories are not protected by the\n> usual default configuration \"require all denied\", these requests\n> can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased\n> pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.\n>\n> This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not\n> earlier versions.\n>\n> Acknowledgements: Reported by Juan Escobar from Dreamlab\n> Technologies, Fernando Munoz from NULL Life CTF Team, and\n> Shungo Kumasaka",

We have not observed this report/attack in the wild or\n> reported elsewhere in the community at large.\n>\n> All users are advised to upgrade ASAP.\n>\n> The target application may have functionality for importing data from\n> a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL\n> that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this\n> functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by\n> manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.).\n>\n> In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse\n> functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The\n> attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the\n> server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs,\n> the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS\n> metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or\n> perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended\n> to be exposed.\n",

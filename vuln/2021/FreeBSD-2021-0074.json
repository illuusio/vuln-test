Implications include an assertion failure, which\n> could be used for denial-of-service, when verifying signatures on the\n> secp_224r1 and secp521_r1 curves.\n>\n> Even when no assert is triggered in ecdsa_verify, ECC point\n> multiplication may get invalid intermediate values as input, and\n> produce incorrect results. \\[\\...\\] It appears difficult to construct\n> an alleged signature that makes the function misbehave in such a way\n> that an invalid signature is accepted as valid, but such attacks\n> can\\'t be ruled out without further analysis.\n",

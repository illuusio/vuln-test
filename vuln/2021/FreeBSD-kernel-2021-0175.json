To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new\n> redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an\n> attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the\n> /new endpoint. If a user visits a prometheus server with a\n> specially crafted address, they can be redirected to an arbitrary\n> URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In\n> 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. The\n> workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in\n> front of Prometheus.",

A poorly chosen string hashing algorithm meant that the user could control which bucket their data was stored in, allowing a malicious user to direct many inputs to a single bucket. Each subsequent insertion to the same bucket requires a strcmp of every other entry in it. At tens of thousands of entries, each new insertion could keep the CPU busy in a strcmp loop for minutes.\n> The string hashing algorithm has been replaced with a better one, and now also uses a random seed per hash table, so malicious inputs cannot be precomputed.",

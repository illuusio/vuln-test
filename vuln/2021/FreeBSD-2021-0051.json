In other cases,\nerrors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements\nnot being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to\nproperly unmap upon error recovery.\n\n# Impact:\n\nA malicious or buggy frontend driver may be able to cause resource leaks\nin the domain running the corresponding backend driver.\n",

That function may\n> return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for\n> example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by\n> OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or\n> SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to\n> SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This\n> return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the\n> application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback().\n> Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY\n> return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and\n> applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour\n> will depend on the application but it could result in crashes,\n> infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses.\n",

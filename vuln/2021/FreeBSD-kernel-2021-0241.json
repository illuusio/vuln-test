Implications include an assertion failure,\n> which could be used for denial-of-service, when verifying signatures\n> on the secp\\_224r1 and secp521\\_r1 curves.\n>\n> Even when no assert is triggered in ecdsa\\_verify, ECC point\n> multiplication may get invalid intermediate values as input, and\n> produce incorrect results. [...] It appears difficult to construct\n> an alleged signature that makes the function misbehave in such a way\n> that an invalid signature is accepted as valid, but such attacks\n> can't be ruled out without further analysis.",

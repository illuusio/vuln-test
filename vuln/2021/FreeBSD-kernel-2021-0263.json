If a jail is subsequently started with the same root\npath, a lingering jailed process may be able to exploit the window\nduring which a devfs filesystem is mounted but the jail's devfs\nruleset has not been applied, to access device nodes which are\nordinarily inaccessible. If the process is privileged, it may be able\nto escape the jail and gain full access to the system.",

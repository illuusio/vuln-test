An attacker could use a path traversal attack\n> to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like\n> directives.\n>\n> If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual\n> default configuration \\\"require all denied\\\", these requests can\n> succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes,\n> this could allow for remote code execution.\n>\n> This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not\n> earlier versions.\n>\n> Acknowledgements: Reported by Juan Escobar from Dreamlab Technologies,\n> Fernando Munoz from NULL Life CTF Team, and Shungo Kumasaka\n",

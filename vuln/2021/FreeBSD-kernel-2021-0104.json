    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nThe passive mode in FTP communication allows an out of boundary read while\nlibfetch uses strtol to parse the relevant numbers into address bytes. It\ndoes not check if the line ends prematurely. If it does, the for-loop\ncondition checks for \\*p == '\\0' one byte too late because p++ was already\nperformed.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nThe connection buffer size can be controlled by a malicious FTP server\nbecause the size is increased until a newline is encountered (or no more\ncharacters are read). This also allows to move the buffer into more\ninteresting areas within the address space, potentially parsing relevant\nnumbers for the attacker. Since these bytes become available to the server\nin form of a new TCP connection to a constructed port number or even part of\nthe IPv6 address this is a potential information leak.",

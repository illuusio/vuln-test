But the key re-exchange\n> operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on\n> hash of different size, eventually creating `secret\\_hash` of different\n> size than the `session\\_id` has.\n>\n> This becomes an issue when the `session\\_id` memory is zeroized or when\n> it is used again during second key re-exchange.",

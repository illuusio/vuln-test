This parameter, for its purpose, should be different for each\n>    installation, and once set, it cannot be changed. As a result, some sites\n>    have been operating without setting this parameter. This completely\n>    invalidates the security measures described above.\n> 2. Even if this parameter is properly set, it may be considered not being\n>    strong enough against brute force attacks.",

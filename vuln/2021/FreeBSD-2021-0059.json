This leads to a leak of file descriptors.

When \\\"localhost6\\\" is not\n> present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved\n> via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim\\'s\n> DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection\n> can be bypassed by using the \\\"localhost6\\\" domain.

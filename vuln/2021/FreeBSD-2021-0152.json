    "details": "Cedric Buissart reports:\n\n> The function `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` is used to get\n> the uid and pid of the process requesting the action. It does this by\n> sending the unique bus name of the requesting process, which is\n> typically something like \\\":1.96\\\", to `dbus-daemon`. These unique\n> names are assigned and managed by `dbus-daemon` and cannot be forged,\n> so this is a good way to check the privileges of the requesting\n> process.\n>\n> The vulnerability happens when the requesting process disconnects from\n> `dbus-daemon` just before the call to\n> `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` starts. In this scenario, the\n> unique bus name is no longer valid, so `dbus-daemon` sends back an\n> error reply. This error case is handled in\n> `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` by setting the value of the\n> `error` parameter, but it still returns `TRUE`, rather than `FALSE`.\n> This behavior means that all callers of\n> `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` need to carefully check\n> whether an error was set. If the calling function forgets to check for\n> errors then it will think that the uid of the requesting process is 0\n> (because the `AsyncGetBusNameCredsData` struct is zero initialized).\n> In other words, it will think that the action was requested by a root\n> process, and will therefore allow it.\n",

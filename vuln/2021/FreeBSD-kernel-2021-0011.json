This could allows attackers with control over\n> Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging\n> configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a\n> Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread\n> Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input\n> data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of\n> service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 makes a best-effort attempt\n> to restrict JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Log4j\n> 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup\n> patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.",

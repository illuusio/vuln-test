    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nGrant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a\nnumber of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or\nfailure of each one reported to the backend driver, and the backend\ndriver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions\nbased on the success or failure of each operation.\n\nUnfortunately, when running in HVM/PVH mode, the FreeBSD backend\ndrivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying\ntheir success from the success of related batch elements. In other\ncases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch\nelements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be\npossible to properly unmap upon error recovery.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nA malicious or buggy frontend driver may be able to cause resource\nleaks in the domain running the corresponding backend driver.",

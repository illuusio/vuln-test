Initially, both of them are the same, but after\n> key re-exchange, previous \\`session_id\\` is kept and used as an input\n> to new \\`secret_hash\\`.\n>\n> Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which\n> worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange\n> operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based\n> on hash of different size, eventually creating \\`secret_hash\\` of\n> different size than the \\`session_id\\` has.\n>\n> This becomes an issue when the \\`session_id\\` memory is zeroized or\n> when it is used again during second key re-exchange.\n",

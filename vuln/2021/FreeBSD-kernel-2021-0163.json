    "details": "Cedric Buissart reports:\n\n> The function `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` is used to get the\n> uid and pid of the process requesting the action. It does this by\n> sending the unique bus name of the requesting process, which is\n> typically something like \":1.96\", to `dbus-daemon`. These unique names\n> are assigned and managed by `dbus-daemon` and cannot be forged, so this\n> is a good way to check the privileges of the requesting process.\n>\n> The vulnerability happens when the requesting process disconnects from\n> `dbus-daemon` just before the call to\n> `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` starts. In this scenario, the\n> unique bus name is no longer valid, so `dbus-daemon` sends back an error\n> reply. This error case is handled in\n> `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` by setting the value of the\n> `error` parameter, but it still returns `TRUE`, rather than `FALSE`.\n> This behavior means that all callers of\n> `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` need to carefully check whether\n> an error was set. If the calling function forgets to check for errors\n> then it will think that the uid of the requesting process is 0 (because\n> the `AsyncGetBusNameCredsData` struct is zero initialized). In other\n> words, it will think that the action was requested by a root process,\n> and will therefore allow it.",

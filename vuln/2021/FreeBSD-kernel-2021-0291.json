This is part of the fix for CVE-2021-3156.\n>\n> Fixed a potential buffer overflow when unescaping backslashes in\n> the command's arguments. Normally, sudo escapes special characters\n> when running a command via a shell (sudo -s or sudo -i). However,\n> it was also possible to run sudoedit with the -s or -i flags in\n> which case no escaping had actually been done, making a buffer\n> overflow possible. This fixes CVE-2021-3156.",

For example, it was used as following:\n>\n> - To be used as a salt to encrypt passwords stored in the database by\n>   the RC4 symmetric key algorithm.\n>\n>   Note that RC4 is no longer considered secure enough and is not\n>   supported in the current version of Sympa.\n>\n> - To prevent attackers from sending crafted messages to achieve XSS\n>   and so on in message archives.\n>\n> There were the following problems with the use of this parameter.\n>\n> 1.  This parameter, for its purpose, should be different for each\n>     installation, and once set, it cannot be changed. As a result,\n>     some sites have been operating without setting this parameter.\n>     This completely invalidates the security measures described above.\n> 2.  Even if this parameter is properly set, it may be considered not\n>     being strong enough against brute force attacks.\n",

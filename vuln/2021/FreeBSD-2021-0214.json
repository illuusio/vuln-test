A poorly chosen string hashing algorithm meant that\n> the user could control which bucket their data was stored in, allowing\n> a malicious user to direct many inputs to a single bucket. Each\n> subsequent insertion to the same bucket requires a strcmp of every\n> other entry in it. At tens of thousands of entries, each new insertion\n> could keep the CPU busy in a strcmp loop for minutes. The string\n> hashing algorithm has been replaced with a better one, and now also\n> uses a random seed per hash table, so malicious inputs cannot be\n> precomputed.\n",

This is part\n> of the fix for CVE-2021-3156.\n>\n> Fixed a potential buffer overflow when unescaping backslashes in the\n> command\\'s arguments. Normally, sudo escapes special characters when\n> running a command via a shell (sudo -s or sudo -i). However, it was\n> also possible to run sudoedit with the -s or -i flags in which case no\n> escaping had actually been done, making a buffer overflow possible.\n> This fixes CVE-2021-3156.\n",

If the DoWrite method\n> does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as\n> part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to\n> corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other\n> exploits.\n>\n> # HTTP Request Smuggling in nodejs (Low) (CVE-2020-8287)\n>\n> Affected versions of Node.js allow two copies of a header field in a\n> http request.

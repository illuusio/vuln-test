In particular, tmpfs(5),\nsmbfs(5), autofs(5) and mqueuefs(5) were failing to do so. As a result,\neight uninitialized kernel stack bytes may be leaked to userspace by\nthese file systems. This problem is not present in FreeBSD 11.\n\nAdditionally, msdosfs(5) was failing to zero-fill a pair of padding\nfields in the dirent structure, resulting in a leak of three\nuninitialized bytes.\n\n# Impact:\n\nKernel stack disclosures may leak sensitive information which could be\nused to compromise the security of the system.\n",

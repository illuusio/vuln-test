If an attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to\n> visit carefully staged content, the attacker can use it to\n> redirect the user to a vulnerable Pubcookie application\n> server and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.\n>\n> These vulnerabilities are classified as \\*high\\* due to the\n> nature and purpose of Pubcookie application servers for user\n> authentication and Web Single Sign-on (SSO). An attacker\n> who injects malicious script through the vulnerabilities\n> might steal private Pubcookie data including a user's\n> authentication assertion (\"granting\") cookies and\n> application session cookies.",

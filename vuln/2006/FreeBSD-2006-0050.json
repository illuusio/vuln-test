This is done\nthrough the verification of sequence numbers. A programming error in the\nfast_ipsec(4) implementation results in the sequence number associated\nwith a Security Association not being updated, allowing packets to\nunconditionally pass sequence number verification checks.\n\n# Impact\n\nAn attacker able to intercept IPSec packets can replay them. If higher\nlevel protocols which do not provide any protection against packet\nreplays (e.g., UDP) are used, this may have a variety of effects.\n\n# Workaround\n\nNo workaround is available.\n",

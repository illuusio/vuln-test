This vulnerability is caused by\nimproper checking of memory allocations within the\n\"array\\_push()\" function. An attacker could trigger this\nvulnerability by passing a lot of \"-r\" or \"-j\" flags from\nthe command line, this only applies when the application is\nconfigured to allow command line options, or by passing a lot\nof resource names when the application was started with the\n\"-m\" flag set. This could lead to a Denial or Service or\ncould allow remote access to the targeted system.",

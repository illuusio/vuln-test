While both mechanisms are implemented\nin the server, a change in the build process caused the \\\"securenets\\\"\naccess restrictions to be inadvertantly disabled.\n\n# Impact\n\nypserv(8) will not load or process any of the networks or hosts\nspecified in the /var/yp/securenets file, rendering those access\ncontrols ineffective.\n\n# Workaround\n\nOne possible workaround is to use /etc/hosts.allow for access control,\nas shown by examples in that file.\n\nAnother workaround is to use a firewall (e.g., ipfw(4), ipf(4), or\npf(4)) to limit access to RPC functions from untrusted systems or\nnetworks, but due to the complexities of RPC, it might be difficult to\ncreate a set of firewall rules which accomplish this without blocking\nall access to the machine in question.\n",

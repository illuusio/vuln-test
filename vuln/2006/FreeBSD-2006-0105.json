With\n> regards to this vulnerability discovered, when character set unaware\n> escaping is used (e.g., addslashes() in PHP), it is possible to bypass\n> it in some multibyte character sets (e.g., SJIS, BIG5 and GBK). As a\n> result, a function like addslashes() is not able to prevent SQL\n> injection attacks. It is impossible to fix this on the server side.\n> The best solution is for applications to use character set aware\n> escaping offered in a function like mysql_real_escape().\n>\n> Workarounds:\n>\n> One can use NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode as a workaround for a bug in\n> mysql_real_escape_string(), if you cannot upgrade your server for some\n> reason. It will enable SQL standard compatibility mode, where\n> backslash is not considered a special character.\n",

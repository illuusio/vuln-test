The first vulnerability is caused by\nimproper checking of the src/input/libreal/real.c \\\"real_parse_sdp()\\\"\nfunction. A remote attacker could exploit this by tricking an user to\nconnect to a preparated server potentially causing a buffer overflow.\nAnother buffer overflow had been found in the libmms library,\npotentially allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service\nvulnerability, and possible remote code execution through the following\nfunctions: send_command, string_utf16, get_data and get_media_packets.\nOther functions might be affected as well.\n",

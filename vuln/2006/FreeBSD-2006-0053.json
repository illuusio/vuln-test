Once the user\n> visits a website under the control of an attacker, it is possible in a\n> default install of RealPlayer to force a web-browser to use RealPlayer\n> to connect to an arbitrary server, even when it is not the default\n> application for handling those types, by the use of embedded object\n> tags in a webpage. This may allow automated exploitation when the page\n> is viewed.\n",

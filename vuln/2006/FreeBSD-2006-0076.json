As a\nresult of this discrepancy remaining unnoticed until now, the FreeBSD\nkernel does not restore the contents of the FOP, FIP, and FDP registers\nbetween context switches.\n\n# Impact\n\nOn affected processors, a local attacker can monitor the execution path\nof a process which uses floating-point operations. This may allow an\nattacker to steal cryptographic keys or other sensitive information.\n\n# Workaround\n\nNo workaround is available, but systems which do not use AMD Athlon,\nDuron, Athlon MP, Athlon XP, Athlon64, Athlon64 FX, Opteron, Turion, or\nSempron processors are not vulnerable.\n",

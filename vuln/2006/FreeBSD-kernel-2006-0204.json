This problem exists\n> in PostgreSQL 7.3.\\* through 8.0.\\*. The recommended fix is\n> to disable public EXECUTE access for these functions. This\n> does not affect normal usage of the functions for character\n> set conversion, but it will prevent misuse.\n>\n> The other error is that the contrib/tsearch2 module\n> misdeclares several functions as returning type \"internal\"\n> when they do not have any \"internal\" argument. This breaks\n> the type safety of \"internal\" by allowing users to\n> construct SQL commands that invoke other functions accepting\n> \"internal\" arguments. The consequences of this have not been\n> investigated in detail, but it is certainly at least possible\n> to crash the backend.",

Since this attack can be performed over multiple connections\nsimultaneously, it is possible to cause up to MaxStartups (10 by\ndefault) sshd processes to use all the CPU time they can obtain.\n\\[CVE-2006-4924\\]\n\nThe OpenSSH project believe that the race condition can lead to a Denial\nof Service or potentially remote code execution, but the FreeBSD\nSecurity Team has been unable to verify the exact impact.\n\\[CVE-2006-5051\\]\n\n# Workaround\n\nThe attack against the CRC compensation attack detector can be avoided\nby disabling SSH Protocol version 1 support in sshd_config(5).\n\nThere is no workaround for the second issue.\n",

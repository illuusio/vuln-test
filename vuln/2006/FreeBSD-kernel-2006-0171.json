    "details": "Nathan Dors of the Pubcookie Project reports:\n\n> Multiple non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities were found\n> in the Pubcookie login server's compiled binary \"index.cgi\"\n> CGI program. The CGI program mishandles untrusted data when\n> printing responses to the browser. This makes the program\n> vulnerable to carefully crafted requests containing script\n> or HTML. If an attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to\n> visit carefully staged content, the attacker can use it to\n> redirect the user to his or her local Pubcookie login page\n> and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.\n>\n> These vulnerabilities are classified as \\*critical\\* due\n> to the nature and purpose of the Pubcookie login server for\n> user authentication and Web Single Sign-on (SSO). Specific\n> threats include:\n>\n> * An attacker who injects malicious script through the\n>   vulnerabilities might steal senstive user data including\n>   a user's authentication credentials (usernames and\n>   passwords);\n> * An attacker who injects malicious script through the\n>   vulnerabilities might steal private Pubcookie data\n>   including a user's authentication assertion (\"granting\")\n>   cookies and SSO (\"login\") session cookies;\n> * An attacker who injects HTML tags through the\n>   vulnerabilities might deface a site's Pubcookie login page\n>   for a single visit by a single user (i.e. a non-persistent\n>   defacement).\n>\n> At the heart of these threats lies a violation of the\n> user's trust in the Pubcookie login server.",

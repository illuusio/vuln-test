The checks to\n> ensure this file is accessible only to the owner take place using the\n> filename after the file is opened for writing, but before any data is\n> written.\n\n> Various components of the toolkit use files in shared directories to\n> store information, some being sensitive information. For example, the\n> tool to create proxy certificates, stores the generated proxy\n> certificate by default in /tmp. Specific vulnerabilities in handling\n> such files were reported in myproxy-admin-adduser, grid-ca-sign and\n> grid-security-config.\n",

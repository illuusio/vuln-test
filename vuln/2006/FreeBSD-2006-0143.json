The function which queries\n>   the server uses a buffer of 20 bytes and one of 9 for storing the\n>   category and ID strings received from the server while the buffer\n>   which contains this server\\'s response is 32768 bytes long.\n>   Naturally for exploiting this bug the attacker must have control of\n>   the freedb server specified in the AlsaPlayer\\'s configuration.\n\nThese vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary\ncode, possibly gaining access to the system.\n",

This makes the program vulnerable to carefully crafted\n> requests containing script or HTML. If an attacker can lure an\n> unsuspecting user to visit carefully staged content, the attacker can\n> use it to redirect the user to his or her local Pubcookie login page\n> and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.\n>\n> These vulnerabilities are classified as \\*critical\\* due to the nature\n> and purpose of the Pubcookie login server for user authentication and\n> Web Single Sign-on (SSO). Specific threats include:\n>\n> - An attacker who injects malicious script through the vulnerabilities\n>   might steal senstive user data including a user\\'s authentication\n>   credentials (usernames and passwords);\n> - An attacker who injects malicious script through the vulnerabilities\n>   might steal private Pubcookie data including a user\\'s\n>   authentication assertion (\\\"granting\\\") cookies and SSO (\\\"login\\\")\n>   session cookies;\n> - An attacker who injects HTML tags through the vulnerabilities might\n>   deface a site\\'s Pubcookie login page for a single visit by a single\n>   user (i.e. a non-persistent defacement).\n>\n> At the heart of these threats lies a violation of the user\\'s trust in\n> the Pubcookie login server.\n",

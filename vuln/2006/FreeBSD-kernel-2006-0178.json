This is done through the verification of sequence\nnumbers. A programming error in the fast\\_ipsec(4)\nimplementation results in the sequence number associated with\na Security Association not being updated, allowing packets to\nunconditionally pass sequence number verification checks.\n\nImpact\n======\n\nAn attacker able to intercept IPSec packets can replay\nthem. If higher level protocols which do not provide any\nprotection against packet replays (e.g., UDP) are used, this\nmay have a variety of effects.\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nNo workaround is available.",

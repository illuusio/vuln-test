Due to incorrect\nhandling of IP fragments, this pointer fails to get\ninitialized.\n\nImpact:\n\nAn attacker can cause the firewall to crash by sending ICMP\nIP fragments to or through firewalls which match any reset,\nreject or unreach actions.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nChange any reset, reject or unreach actions to deny. It\nshould be noted that this will result in packets being\nsilently discarded.",

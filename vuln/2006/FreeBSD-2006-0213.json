    "details": "Werner Koch reports:\n\n> GnuPG uses data structures called filters to process OpenPGP messages.\n> These filters are used in a similar way as a pipelines in the shell.\n> For communication between these filters context structures are used.\n> These are usually allocated on the stack and passed to the filter\n> functions. At most places the OpenPGP data stream fed into these\n> filters is closed before the context structure gets deallocated. While\n> decrypting encrypted packets, this may not happen in all cases and the\n> filter may use a void contest structure filled with garbage. An\n> attacker may control this garbage. The filter context includes another\n> context used by the low-level decryption to access the decryption\n> algorithm. This is done using a function pointer. By carefully\n> crafting an OpenPGP message, an attacker may control this function\n> pointer and call an arbitrary function of the process. Obviously an\n> exploit needs to prepared for a specific version, compiler, libc, etc\n> to be successful - but it is definitely doable.\n>\n> Fixing this is obvious: We need to allocate the context on the heap\n> and use a reference count to keep it valid as long as either the\n> controlling code or the filter code needs it.\n>\n> We have checked all other usages of such a stack based filter contexts\n> but fortunately found no other vulnerable places. This allows to\n> release a relatively small patch. However, for reasons of code\n> cleanness and easier audits we will soon start to change all these\n> stack based filter contexts to heap based ones.\n",

However, PHP and some other\n> types allows additional file suffixes, such as .php.en, .php.1, and\n> .php.2. TWiki does not check for these suffixes, e.g. it is possible\n> to upload php scripts with such suffixes without the .txt filename\n> padding.\n\nThis issue can also be worked around with a restrictive web server\nconfiguration. See the [TWiki Security\nAlert](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecurityAlertSecureFileUploads)\nfor more information about how to do this.\n",

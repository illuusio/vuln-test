The\nfirst vulnerability is caused by improper checking of the\nsrc/input/libreal/real.c \"real\\_parse\\_sdp()\" function.\nA remote attacker could exploit this by tricking an user to\nconnect to a preparated server potentially causing a buffer\noverflow. Another buffer overflow had been found in the\nlibmms library, potentially allowing a remote attacker to\ncause a denial of service vulnerability, and possible remote\ncode execution through the following functions: send\\_command,\nstring\\_utf16, get\\_data and get\\_media\\_packets. Other functions\nmight be affected as well.",

This problem\n> exists in PostgreSQL 7.3.\\* through 8.0.\\*. The recommended fix is to\n> disable public EXECUTE access for these functions. This does not\n> affect normal usage of the functions for character set conversion, but\n> it will prevent misuse.\n>\n> The other error is that the contrib/tsearch2 module misdeclares\n> several functions as returning type \\\"internal\\\" when they do not have\n> any \\\"internal\\\" argument. This breaks the type safety of \\\"internal\\\"\n> by allowing users to construct SQL commands that invoke other\n> functions accepting \\\"internal\\\" arguments. The consequences of this\n> have not been investigated in detail, but it is certainly at least\n> possible to crash the backend.\n",

As a result of this\ndiscrepancy remaining unnoticed until now, the FreeBSD kernel\ndoes not restore the contents of the FOP, FIP, and FDP\nregisters between context switches.\n\nImpact\n======\n\nOn affected processors, a local attacker can monitor the\nexecution path of a process which uses floating-point\noperations. This may allow an attacker to steal\ncryptographic keys or other sensitive information.\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nNo workaround is available, but systems which do not use AMD\nAthlon, Duron, Athlon MP, Athlon XP, Athlon64, Athlon64 FX,\nOpteron, Turion, or Sempron processors are not vulnerable.",

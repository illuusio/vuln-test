Also for a\nrecursive DNS server, an assertion failure can occur when\nprocessing a query whose reply will contain more than one\nSIG(covered) RRset.\n\nFor an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535 DNSSEC\nzone which is queried for the SIG records where there are\nmultiple SIG(covered) RRsets (e.g. a zone apex), named(8)\nwill trigger an assertion failure when it tries to construct\nthe response.\n\nImpact\n======\n\nAn attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server\nand is able to send a sufficiently large number of recursive\nqueries, or is able to get the DNS server to return more than\none SIG(covered) RRsets can stop the functionality of the DNS\nservice.\n\nAn attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a\nRFC 2535 DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nA possible workaround is to only allow trusted clients to\nperform recursive queries.",

The function which queries the\n>   server uses a buffer of 20 bytes and one of 9 for storing\n>   the category and ID strings received from the server while\n>   the buffer which contains this server's response is 32768\n>   bytes long. Naturally for exploiting this bug the attacker\n>   must have control of the freedb server specified in the\n>   AlsaPlayer's configuration.\n\nThese vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to\nexecute arbitrary code, possibly gaining access to the\nsystem.",

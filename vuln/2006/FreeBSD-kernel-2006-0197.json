When using any current version of GnuPG for\n> unattended signature verification (e.g. by scripts and\n> mail programs), false positive signature verification of\n> detached signatures may occur.\n>\n> This problem affects the tool \\*gpgv\\*, as well as using\n> \"gpg --verify\" to imitate gpgv, if only the exit code of\n> the process is used to decide whether a detached signature\n> is valid. This is a plausible mode of operation for\n> gpgv.\n>\n> If, as suggested, the --status-fd generated output is\n> used to decide whether a signature is valid, no problem\n> exists. In particular applications making use of the\n> GPGME library[2] are not affected.",

These components mishandle\n> untrusted data when printing responses to the browser. This makes them\n> vulnerable to carefully crafted requests containing script or HTML. If\n> an attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to visit carefully staged\n> content, the attacker can use it to redirect the user to a vulnerable\n> Pubcookie application server and attempt to exploit the XSS\n> vulnerabilities.\n>\n> These vulnerabilities are classified as \\*high\\* due to the nature and\n> purpose of Pubcookie application servers for user authentication and\n> Web Single Sign-on (SSO). An attacker who injects malicious script\n> through the vulnerabilities might steal private Pubcookie data\n> including a user\\'s authentication assertion (\\\"granting\\\") cookies\n> and application session cookies.\n",

Bogofilter would usually be\n> processing untrusted data received from the network at that time.\n>\n> This problem was aggravated by an unrelated bug that made bogofilter\n> process binary attachments as though they were text, and attempt\n> charset conversion on them. Given the MIME default character set,\n> US-ASCII, all input octets in the range 0x80\\...0xff were considered\n> invalid input sequences and could trigger the heap corruption.\n",

[CVE-2006-0380]\n\nImpact:\n\nPortions of kernel memory may be disclosed to local users.\nSuch memory might contain sensitive information, such as\nportions of the file cache or terminal buffers. This\ninformation might be directly useful, or it might be\nleveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some way. For\nexample, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered\npassword.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nNo workaround is available.",

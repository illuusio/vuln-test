    "details": "Andreas Seltenreich reports that hashcash is prone to a heap overflow\nvulnerability. This vulnerability is caused by improper checking of\nmemory allocations within the \\\"array_push()\\\" function. An attacker\ncould trigger this vulnerability by passing a lot of \\\"-r\\\" or \\\"-j\\\"\nflags from the command line, this only applies when the application is\nconfigured to allow command line options, or by passing a lot of\nresource names when the application was started with the \\\"-m\\\" flag\nset. This could lead to a Denial or Service or could allow remote access\nto the targeted system.\n",

    "details": "Problem description:\n\nA number of issues has been discovered in cpio:\n\nWhen creating a new file, cpio closes the file before setting\nits permissions. (CVE-2005-1111)\n\nWhen extracting files cpio does not properly sanitize file\nnames to filter out \"..\" components, even if the\n--no-absolute-filenames option is used. (CVE-2005-1229)\n\nWhen adding large files (larger than 4 GB) to a cpio archive\non 64-bit platforms an internal buffer might overflow.\n(CVE-2005-4268)\n\nImpact\n\nThe first problem can allow a local attacker to change the\npermissions of files owned by the user executing cpio providing\nthat they have write access to the directory in which the file\nis being extracted. (CVE-2005-1111)\n\nThe lack of proper file name sanitation can allow an attacker\nto overwrite arbitrary local files when extracting files from\na cpio archive. (CVE-2005-1229)\n\nThe buffer-overflow on 64-bit platforms could lead cpio to a\nDenial-of-Service situation (crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code with the permissions of the user running\ncpio. (CVE-2005-4268)\n\nWorkaround\n\nUse a different utility to create and extract cpio archives,\nfor example pax(1) or (on FreeBSD 5.3 or later) tar(1). If\nthis is not possible, do not extract untrusted archives and\nwhen running on 64-bit platforms do not add untrusted files\nto cpio archives.",

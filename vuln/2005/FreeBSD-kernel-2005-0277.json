A Content-length header should only appear once in a\n>    valid request or response. Multiple Content-length\n>    headers, in conjunction with specially crafted requests,\n>    may allow Squid's cache to be poisoned with bad content\n>    in certain situations.\n> 2. CR characters is only allowed as part of the CR NL\n>    line terminator, not alone. This to ensure that all\n>    involved agrees on the structure of HTTP headers.\n> 3. Rejects requests/responses that have whitespace in an\n>    HTTP header name.\n\nTo enable these strict parsing rules, update to at least\nsquid-2.5.7\\_9 and specify `relaxed_header_parser\noff` in squid.conf.",

This vulnerability could be leveraged by\n> an attacker to execute code remotely on a Snort sensor\n> where the Back Orifice preprocessor is enabled. However,\n> there are a number of factors that make remote code\n> execution difficult to achieve across different builds of\n> Snort on different platforms, even on the same platform\n> with different compiler versions, and it is more likely\n> that an attacker could use the vulnerability as a denial\n> of service attack.\n>\n> The Back Orifice preprocessor can be disabled by\n> commenting out the line \"preprocessor bo\" in\n> snort.conf. This can be done in any text editor using the\n> following procedure:\n>\n> 1. Locate the line \"preprocessor bo\"\n> 2. Comment out this line by preceding it with a hash\n>    (#). The new line will look like \"#preprocessor bo\"\n> 3. Save the file\n> 4. Restart snort",

This means that a\n> potential attacker can retrieve any file accessible by the\n> webserver user.\n>\n> Additionally it is possible to upload arbitrary files (up\n> to a configured file length) to any place the webserver\n> has write access too.\n>\n> For obvious reasons this can lead to the execution of\n> arbitrary code if it possible to upload files to the\n> document root or it's subdirectories. One example of a\n> configuration would be f.e. running Trac and\n> s9y/wordpress with writeable content directories on the\n> same webserver.\n>\n> Another potential usage of this exploit would be to abuse\n> Trac powered webservers as storage for f.e. torrent\n> files.",

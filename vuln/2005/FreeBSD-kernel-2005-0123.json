The\n> `ENSURE_BITS()` macro fails to check for zero\n> length reads, allowing a carefully constructed cabinet\n> file to cause an infinite loop.\n>\n> ClamAV is used in a number of mail gateway\n> products. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to\n> send a specially constructed CAB file through a mail\n> gateway or personal anti-virus client utilizing the ClamAV\n> scanning engine. The infinate loop will cause the ClamAV\n> software to use all available processor resources,\n> resulting in a denial of service or severe degradation to\n> system performance. Remote exploitation can be achieved by\n> sending a malicious file in an e-mail message or during an\n> HTTP session.",

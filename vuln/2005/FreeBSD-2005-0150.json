    "details": "# Problem description and impact\n\nWhen running on processors supporting Hyper-Threading Technology, it is\npossible for a malicious thread to monitor the execution of another\nthread.\n\nInformation may be disclosed to local users, allowing in many cases for\nprivilege escalation. For example, on a multi-user system, it may be\npossible to steal cryptographic keys used in applications such as\nOpenSSH or SSL-enabled web servers.\n\n**NOTE:** Similar problems may exist in other simultaneous\nmultithreading implementations, or even some systems in the absence of\nsimultaneous multithreading. However, current research has only\ndemonstrated this flaw in Hyper-Threading Technology, where shared\nmemory caches are used.\n\n# Workaround\n\nSystems not using processors with Hyper-Threading Technology support are\nnot affected by this issue. On systems which are affected, the security\nflaw can be eliminated by setting the \\\"machdep.hlt_logical_cpus\\\"\ntunable:\n\n    # echo \"machdep.hlt_logical_cpus=1\" >> /boot/loader.conf\n\nThe system must be rebooted in order for tunables to take effect.\n\nUse of this workaround is not recommended on \\\"dual-core\\\" systems, as\nthis workaround will also disable one of the processor cores.\n",

Successful\n> exploitation requires that the user has access to the full HTML input\n> format. Ref: sa-2005-007\n>\n> 2\\) An input validation error in the attachment handling can be\n> exploited to upload a malicious image with embedded HTML and script\n> content, which will be executed in a user\\'s browser session in\n> context of an affected site when viewed directly with the Microsoft\n> Internet Explorer browser. This can also be exploited to inject\n> arbitrary HTTP headers, which will be included in the response sent to\n> the user. Ref: sa-2005-008\n>\n> 3\\) The problem is that it is possible to bypass the \\\"access user\n> profile\\\" permission. However, this cannot be exploited to modify\n> data. Successful exploitation requires that the server runs PHP 5.\n> Ref: sa-2005-009\n",

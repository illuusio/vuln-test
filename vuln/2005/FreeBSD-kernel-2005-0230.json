The vulnerabilities apply to those points:\n>\n> 1. css/phpmyadmin.css.php was vulnerable against\n>    `$cfg` and `GLOBALS` variable\n>    injections. This way, a possible attacker could\n>    manipulate any configuration parameter. Using\n>    phpMyAdmin's theming mechanism, he was able to include\n>    arbitrary files. This is especially dangerous if php is\n>    not running in safe mode.\n> 2. A possible attacker could manipulate phpMyAdmin's\n>    localized strings via the URL and inject harmful\n>    JavaScript code this way, which could be used for XSS\n>    attacks.",

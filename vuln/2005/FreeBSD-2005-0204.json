Having analysed his bug we\n> come to the conclusion, that the malfunctioning input filters, which\n> were already mentioned in the previous advisory are also responsible\n> for this bug still being exploitable.\n\n> A HTTP headers bypass switch can also be used to completely bypass the\n> authentification system of Cacti. As admin it is possible to execute\n> shell commands with the permission of the webserver.\n>\n> While looking at the source of Cacti a HTTP headers bypass switch was\n> discovered, that also switches off a call to `session_start()` and the\n> manual application of `addslashes()` in case of\n> `magic_quotes_gpc=Off`.\n>\n> When register_globals is turned on\\* an attacker can use this switch\n> to disables Cacti\\'s use of PHP\\'s session support and therefore\n> supply the session variables on his own through f.e. the URL.\n> Additionally using the switch renders several SQL statements\n> vulnerable to SQL Injections attacks, when magic_quotes_gpc is turned\n> off, which is the recommended setting.\n>\n> Logged in as an admin it is possible to issue shell commands.\n>\n> (\\*) register_globals is turned off by default since PHP 4.2 but is\n> activated on most servers because of older scripts requiring it.\n",

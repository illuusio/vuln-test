The stalled TCP connection my\nbe closed after some time by the other host.\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nIn some cases it may be possible to defend against these\nattacks by blocking the attack packets using a firewall.\nPackets used to effect either of these attacks would have\nspoofed source IP addresses.",

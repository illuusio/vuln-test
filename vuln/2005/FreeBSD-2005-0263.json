The first format string bug occurs when viewing the full vCard\n>     data attached to an e-mail message.\n> 2.  The second format string bug occurs when displaying contact data\n>     from remote LDAP servers.\n> 3.  The third format string bug occurs when displaying task list data\n>     from remote servers.\n> 4.  The fourth, and least serious, format string bug occurs when the\n>     user goes to the Calendars tab to save task list data that is\n>     vulnerable to problem 3 above. Other calendar entries that do not\n>     come from task lists are also affected.\n",

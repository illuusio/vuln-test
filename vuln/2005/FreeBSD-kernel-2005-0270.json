Unfortunately this function\ndoes not check the length of the buffer in which the read data is stored\nand only stops reading when a newline character is found.\n\nA malicious NNTP server could use this bug to cause a buffer overflow\nby sending an overly long response. Such an overflow allows arbitrary\ncode to be executed, with the privileges of the newspost process, on the\naffected systems.",

    "details": "Problem description and impact\n==============================\n\nWhen running on processors supporting Hyper-Threading Technology, it\nis possible for a malicious thread to monitor the execution of another\nthread.\n\nInformation may be disclosed to local users, allowing in many\ncases for privilege escalation. For example, on a multi-user\nsystem, it may be possible to steal cryptographic keys used in\napplications such as OpenSSH or SSL-enabled web servers.\n\n**NOTE:** Similar problems may exist in other\nsimultaneous multithreading implementations, or even some\nsystems in the absence of simultaneous multithreading.\nHowever, current research has only demonstrated this flaw in\nHyper-Threading Technology, where shared memory caches are\nused.\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nSystems not using processors with Hyper-Threading Technology\nsupport are not affected by this issue. On systems which are\naffected, the security flaw can be eliminated by setting the\n\"machdep.hlt\\_logical\\_cpus\" tunable:\n\n```\n# echo \"machdep.hlt_logical_cpus=1\" >> /boot/loader.conf\n```\n\nThe system must be rebooted in order for tunables to take effect.\n\nUse of this workaround is not recommended on \"dual-core\" systems, as\nthis workaround will also disable one of the processor\ncores.",

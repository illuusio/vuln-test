    "details": "Problem Description\n===================\n\nTwo problems have been discovered relating to the\nextraction of bzip2-compressed files. First, a carefully\nconstructed invalid bzip2 archive can cause bzip2 to enter\nan infinite loop. Second, when creating a new file, bzip2\ncloses the file before setting its permissions.\n\nImpact\n======\n\nThe first problem can cause bzip2 to extract a bzip2\narchive to an infinitely large file. If bzip2 is used in\nautomated processing of untrusted files this could be\nexploited by an attacker to create an denial-of-service\nsituation by exhausting disk space or by consuming all\navailable cpu time.\n\nThe second problem can allow a local attacker to change the\npermissions of local files owned by the user executing bzip2\nproviding that they have write access to the directory in\nwhich the file is being extracted.\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\nDo not uncompress bzip2 archives from untrusted sources and\ndo not uncompress files in directories where untrusted users\nhave write access.",

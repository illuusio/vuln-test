As part of the statistics\n> reporting function, AWStats displays information about the\n> most common referrer values that caused users to visit the\n> website. The referrer data is used without proper\n> sanitation in an `eval()` statement, resulting\n> in the execution of arbitrary perl code.\n>\n> Successful exploitation results in the execution of\n> arbitrary commands with permissions of the web\n> service. Exploitation will not occur until the stats page\n> has been regenerated with the tainted referrer values from\n> the http access log. Note that AWStats is only vulnerable\n> in situations where at least one URLPlugin is enabled.",

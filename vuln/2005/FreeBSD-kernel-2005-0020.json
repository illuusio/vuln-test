A user who has enabled\n> the status bar and disabled tooltips can be affected by\n> this. Neither of these settings are Opera's defaults.\n>\n> This exploit is mostly of interest to users who disable\n> JavaScript. If JavaScript is enabled, any link target or\n> form action can be overridden by the script. The tooltip\n> and the statusbar can only be trusted to show the true\n> location if JavaScript is disabled.\n\n> Java code using LiveConnect methods to remove a property\n> of a JavaScript object may in some cases use null pointers\n> that can make Opera crash. This crash is not exploitable\n> and such code is rare on the web.",

The stalled\nTCP connection my be closed after some time by the other host.\n\n# Workaround\n\nIn some cases it may be possible to defend against these attacks by\nblocking the attack packets using a firewall. Packets used to effect\neither of these attacks would have spoofed source IP addresses.\n",

This value is used as an\n> index in Flash.ocx to reference an array of function pointers. This\n> can be exploited via a specially crafted SWF file to cause the index\n> to reference memory that is under the attacker\\'s control, which\n> causes Flash Player to use attacker supplied values as function\n> pointers.\n>\n> Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.\n",

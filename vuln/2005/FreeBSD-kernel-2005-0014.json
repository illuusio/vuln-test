This leads to a single zero byte overflow of the\n> malloced buffer.\n>\n> 2 - pass in a URL with only a question mark as separator\n> (no slash) between the host and the query part of the URL.\n> This leads to a single zero byte overflow of the malloced\n> buffer.\n>\n> Both overflows can be made with the same input string,\n> leading to two single zero byte overwrites.\n>\n> The affected flaw cannot be triggered by a redirect, but\n> the long URL must be passed in \"directly\" to libcurl. It\n> makes this a \"local\" problem. Of course, lots of programs\n> may still pass in user-provided URLs to libcurl without doing\n> much syntax checking of their own, allowing a user to exploit\n> this vulnerability.",

When the\n> victim with that message in his or her inbox starts Elm or simply\n> views the inbox in an already started copy of Elm, the buffer overflow\n> will happen immediately. The overflow is stack-based, and it gives\n> full control over EIP, EBP and EBX. It is caused by a bad sscanf(3)\n> call, using a format string containing \\\"%s\\\" to copy from a long char\n> array to a shorter array.\n",

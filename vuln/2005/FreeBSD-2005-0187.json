This means that a potential attacker can retrieve any file\n> accessible by the webserver user.\n>\n> Additionally it is possible to upload arbitrary files (up to a\n> configured file length) to any place the webserver has write access\n> too.\n>\n> For obvious reasons this can lead to the execution of arbitrary code\n> if it possible to upload files to the document root or it\\'s\n> subdirectories. One example of a configuration would be f.e. running\n> Trac and s9y/wordpress with writeable content directories on the same\n> webserver.\n>\n> Another potential usage of this exploit would be to abuse Trac powered\n> webservers as storage for f.e. torrent files.\n",

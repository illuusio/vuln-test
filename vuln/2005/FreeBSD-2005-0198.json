    "details": "# Problem Description\n\nTwo problems have been discovered relating to the extraction of\nbzip2-compressed files. First, a carefully constructed invalid bzip2\narchive can cause bzip2 to enter an infinite loop. Second, when creating\na new file, bzip2 closes the file before setting its permissions.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe first problem can cause bzip2 to extract a bzip2 archive to an\ninfinitely large file. If bzip2 is used in automated processing of\nuntrusted files this could be exploited by an attacker to create an\ndenial-of-service situation by exhausting disk space or by consuming all\navailable cpu time.\n\nThe second problem can allow a local attacker to change the permissions\nof local files owned by the user executing bzip2 providing that they\nhave write access to the directory in which the file is being extracted.\n\n# Workaround\n\nDo not uncompress bzip2 archives from untrusted sources and do not\nuncompress files in directories where untrusted users have write access.\n",

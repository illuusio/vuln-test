    "details": "Problem Description\n===================\n\nThe ipfw tables lookup code caches the result of the last\nquery. The kernel may process multiple packets\nconcurrently, performing several concurrent table lookups.\nDue to an insufficient locking, a cached result can become\ncorrupted that could cause some addresses to be incorrectly\nmatched against a lookup table.\n\nImpact\n======\n\nWhen lookup tables are used with ipfw, packets may on very\nrare occasions incorrectly match a lookup table. This could\nresult in a packet being treated contrary to the defined\npacket filtering ruleset. For example, a packet may be\nallowed to pass through when it should have been\ndiscarded.\n\nThe problem can only occur on Symmetric Multi-Processor\n(SMP) systems, or on Uni Processor (UP) systems with the\nPREEMPTION kernel option enabled (not the default).\n\nWorkaround\n==========\n\na) Do not use lookup tables.\n\nOR\n\nb) Disable concurrent processing of packets in the network\nstack by setting the \"debug.mpsafenet=0\" tunable:\n\n# echo \"debug.mpsafenet=0\" << /boot/loader.conf",

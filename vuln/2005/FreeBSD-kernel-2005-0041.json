At that point, it will also copy the title\n> from the old image to the newly created image.\n>\n> The 'zoom', 'reduce', and 'rotate' functions are using\n> a fixed length buffer to construct the new title name\n> when an image processing is done. Since the title name\n> in a NIFF format is of varying length, and there are\n> insufficient buffer size validations, the buffer can\n> be overflowed.",

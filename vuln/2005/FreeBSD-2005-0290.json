However, there are a number of factors that make remote code\n> execution difficult to achieve across different builds of Snort on\n> different platforms, even on the same platform with different compiler\n> versions, and it is more likely that an attacker could use the\n> vulnerability as a denial of service attack.\n>\n> The Back Orifice preprocessor can be disabled by commenting out the\n> line \\\"preprocessor bo\\\" in snort.conf. This can be done in any text\n> editor using the following procedure:\n>\n> 1.  Locate the line \\\"preprocessor bo\\\"\n> 2.  Comment out this line by preceding it with a hash (#). The new\n>     line will look like \\\"#preprocessor bo\\\"\n> 3.  Save the file\n> 4.  Restart snort\n",

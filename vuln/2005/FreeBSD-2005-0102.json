The\n> vulnerabilities apply to those points:\n>\n> 1.  css/phpmyadmin.css.php was vulnerable against `$cfg` and `GLOBALS`\n>     variable injections. This way, a possible attacker could\n>     manipulate any configuration parameter. Using phpMyAdmin\\'s\n>     theming mechanism, he was able to include arbitrary files. This is\n>     especially dangerous if php is not running in safe mode.\n> 2.  A possible attacker could manipulate phpMyAdmin\\'s localized\n>     strings via the URL and inject harmful JavaScript code this way,\n>     which could be used for XSS attacks.\n",

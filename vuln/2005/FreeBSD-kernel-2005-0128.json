Having analysed his bug we come to the conclusion,\n> that the malfunctioning input filters, which were already\n> mentioned in the previous advisory are also responsible\n> for this bug still being exploitable.\n\n> A HTTP headers bypass switch can also be used to\n> completely bypass the authentification system of Cacti. As\n> admin it is possible to execute shell commands with the\n> permission of the webserver.\n>\n> While looking at the source of Cacti a HTTP headers\n> bypass switch was discovered, that also switches off a\n> call to `session_start()` and the manual\n> application of `addslashes()` in case of\n> `magic_quotes_gpc=Off`.\n>\n> When register\\_globals is turned on\\* an attacker can use\n> this switch to disables Cacti's use of PHP's session\n> support and therefore supply the session variables on his\n> own through f.e. the URL. Additionally using the switch\n> renders several SQL statements vulnerable to SQL\n> Injections attacks, when magic\\_quotes\\_gpc is turned off,\n> which is the recommended setting.\n>\n> Logged in as an admin it is possible to issue shell\n> commands.\n>\n> (\\*) register\\_globals is turned off by default since PHP\n> 4.2 but is activated on most servers because of older\n> scripts requiring it.",

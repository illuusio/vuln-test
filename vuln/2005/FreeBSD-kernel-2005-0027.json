This value is used as an index in Flash.ocx\n> to reference an array of function pointers. This can be\n> exploited via a specially crafted SWF file to cause\n> the index to reference memory that is under the attacker's\n> control, which causes Flash Player to use attacker\n> supplied values as function pointers.\n>\n> Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary\n> code.",

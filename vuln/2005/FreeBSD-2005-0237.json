To be specific,\n> unless you have your OpenPGP program set up as part of an automated\n> system to accept encrypted messages, decrypt them, and then provide a\n> response to the submitter, then this does not affect you at all.\n\nNote that the \"fix\" in GnuPG does note completely eliminate the\npotential problem:\n\n> These patches disable a portion of the OpenPGP protocol that the\n> attack is exploiting. This change should not be user visible. With the\n> patch in place, this attack will not work using a public-key encrypted\n> message. It will still work using a passphrase-encrypted message.\n",

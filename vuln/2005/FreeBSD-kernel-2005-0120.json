Thus, MySQL\n> replication can lag in between the time that the bug is\n> inserted and when it is marked as private (usually less\n> than a second). If replication lags at this point, the bug\n> summary will be accessible to all users until replication\n> catches up. Also, on a very slow machine, there may be a\n> pause longer than a second that allows users to see the\n> title of the newly-filed bug.",

This leads to a single\n> zero byte overflow of the malloced buffer.\n>\n> 2 - pass in a URL with only a question mark as separator (no slash)\n> between the host and the query part of the URL. This leads to a single\n> zero byte overflow of the malloced buffer.\n>\n> Both overflows can be made with the same input string, leading to two\n> single zero byte overwrites.\n>\n> The affected flaw cannot be triggered by a redirect, but the long URL\n> must be passed in \\\"directly\\\" to libcurl. It makes this a \\\"local\\\"\n> problem. Of course, lots of programs may still pass in user-provided\n> URLs to libcurl without doing much syntax checking of their own,\n> allowing a user to exploit this vulnerability.\n",

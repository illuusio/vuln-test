The second format string bug occurs when displaying\n>    contact data from remote LDAP servers.\n> 3. The third format string bug occurs when displaying\n>    task list data from remote servers.\n> 4. The fourth, and least serious, format string bug\n>    occurs when the user goes to the Calendars tab to save\n>    task list data that is vulnerable to problem 3\n>    above. Other calendar entries that do not come from task\n>    lists are also affected.",

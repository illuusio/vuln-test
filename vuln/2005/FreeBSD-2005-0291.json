At that\n> point, it will also copy the title from the old image to the newly\n> created image.\n>\n> The \\'zoom\\', \\'reduce\\', and \\'rotate\\' functions are using a fixed\n> length buffer to construct the new title name when an image processing\n> is done. Since the title name in a NIFF format is of varying length,\n> and there are insufficient buffer size validations, the buffer can be\n> overflowed.\n",

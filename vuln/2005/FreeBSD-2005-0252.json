The referrer data is used without proper sanitation\n> in an `eval()` statement, resulting in the execution of arbitrary perl\n> code.\n>\n> Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary commands\n> with permissions of the web service. Exploitation will not occur until\n> the stats page has been regenerated with the tainted referrer values\n> from the http access log. Note that AWStats is only vulnerable in\n> situations where at least one URLPlugin is enabled.\n",

    "details": "# Problem Description\n\nThe ipfw tables lookup code caches the result of the last query. The\nkernel may process multiple packets concurrently, performing several\nconcurrent table lookups. Due to an insufficient locking, a cached\nresult can become corrupted that could cause some addresses to be\nincorrectly matched against a lookup table.\n\n# Impact\n\nWhen lookup tables are used with ipfw, packets may on very rare\noccasions incorrectly match a lookup table. This could result in a\npacket being treated contrary to the defined packet filtering ruleset.\nFor example, a packet may be allowed to pass through when it should have\nbeen discarded.\n\nThe problem can only occur on Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) systems,\nor on Uni Processor (UP) systems with the PREEMPTION kernel option\nenabled (not the default).\n\n# Workaround\n\na\\) Do not use lookup tables.\n\nOR\n\nb\\) Disable concurrent processing of packets in the network stack by\nsetting the \\\"debug.mpsafenet=0\\\" tunable:\n\n\\# echo \\\"debug.mpsafenet=0\\\" \\<\\< /boot/loader.conf\n",

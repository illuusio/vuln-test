A \\\"title\\\" which looks like a URL can mislead the user,\n> since the title can say http://nice.familiar.com/, while the form\n> action can be something else.\n>\n> Opera\\'s tooltip says \\\"Title:\\\" before the title text, making a spoof\n> URL less convincing. A user who has enabled the status bar and\n> disabled tooltips can be affected by this. Neither of these settings\n> are Opera\\'s defaults.\n>\n> This exploit is mostly of interest to users who disable JavaScript. If\n> JavaScript is enabled, any link target or form action can be\n> overridden by the script. The tooltip and the statusbar can only be\n> trusted to show the true location if JavaScript is disabled.\n\n> Java code using LiveConnect methods to remove a property of a\n> JavaScript object may in some cases use null pointers that can make\n> Opera crash. This crash is not exploitable and such code is rare on\n> the web.\n",

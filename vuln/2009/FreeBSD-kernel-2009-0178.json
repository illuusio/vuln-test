    "details": "Problem Description\n===================\n\nIPv6 routers may allow \"on-link\" IPv6 nodes to create and\nupdate the router's neighbor cache and forwarding\ninformation. A malicious IPv6 node sharing a common router\nbut on a different physical segment from another node may be\nable to spoof Neighbor Discovery messages, allowing it to\nupdate router information for the victim node.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nAn attacker on a different physical network connected to the\nsame IPv6 router as another node could redirect IPv6 traffic\nintended for that node. This could lead to denial of service\nor improper access to private network traffic.\n\nWorkaround:\n===========\n\nFirewall packet filters can be used to filter incoming\nNeighbor Solicitation messages but may interfere with normal\nIPv6 operation if not configured carefully.\n\nReverse path forwarding checks could be used to make\ngateways, such as routers or firewalls, drop Neighbor\nSolicitation messages from nodes with unexpected source\naddresses on a particular interface.\n\nIPv6 router administrators are encouraged to read RFC 3756\nfor further discussion of Neighbor Discovery security\nimplications.",

Internet Explorer 6\n> and 7 may decode these characters as UTF-7 if they appear before the\n> meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-Type\\\" tag that specifies the page content\n> as UTF-8, despite the fact that Drupal also sends a real HTTP header\n> specifying the content as UTF-8. This behaviour enables malicious\n> users to insert and execute Javascript in the context of the website\n> if site visitors are allowed to post content.\n>\n> In addition, Drupal core also has a very limited information\n> disclosure vulnerability under very specific conditions. If a user is\n> tricked into visiting the site via a specially crafted URL and then\n> submits a form (such as the search box) from that page, the\n> information in their form submission may be directed to a third-party\n> site determined by the URL and thus disclosed to the third party.

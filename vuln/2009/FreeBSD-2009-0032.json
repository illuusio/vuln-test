This can be exploited by replacing an existing sub\n> directory in the directory tree with a symbolic link to an arbitrary\n> file.\n>\n> Successful exploitation may allow changing permissions of arbitrary\n> files, if root uses an application using the vulnerable code to delete\n> files in a directory having a world-writable sub directory.\n",

    "details": "# Problem Description\n\nIPv6 routers may allow \\\"on-link\\\" IPv6 nodes to create and update the\nrouter\\'s neighbor cache and forwarding information. A malicious IPv6\nnode sharing a common router but on a different physical segment from\nanother node may be able to spoof Neighbor Discovery messages, allowing\nit to update router information for the victim node.\n\n# Impact:\n\nAn attacker on a different physical network connected to the same IPv6\nrouter as another node could redirect IPv6 traffic intended for that\nnode. This could lead to denial of service or improper access to private\nnetwork traffic.\n\n# Workaround:\n\nFirewall packet filters can be used to filter incoming Neighbor\nSolicitation messages but may interfere with normal IPv6 operation if\nnot configured carefully.\n\nReverse path forwarding checks could be used to make gateways, such as\nrouters or firewalls, drop Neighbor Solicitation messages from nodes\nwith unexpected source addresses on a particular interface.\n\nIPv6 router administrators are encouraged to read RFC 3756 for further\ndiscussion of Neighbor Discovery security implications.\n",

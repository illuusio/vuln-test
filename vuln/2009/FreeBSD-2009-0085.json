Internet Explorer 6\n> and 7 may decode these characters as UTF-7 if they appear before the\n> \\<meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-Type\\\" /\\> tag that specifies the page\n> content as UTF-8, despite the fact that Drupal also sends a real HTTP\n> header specifying the content as UTF-8. This enables attackers to\n> execute cross site scripting attacks with UTF-7. SA-CORE-2009-005 -\n> Drupal core - Cross site scripting contained an incomplete fix for the\n> issue.

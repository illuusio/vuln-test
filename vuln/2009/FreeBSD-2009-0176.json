This can be exploited to\n> execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\\'s browser session in\n> context of an affected site.\n>\n> The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP\n> requests without performing any validity checks to verify the\n> requests. This can be exploited to e.g. create an arbitrary user with\n> administrative privileges if a logged-in administrative user visits a\n> malicious web site.\n",

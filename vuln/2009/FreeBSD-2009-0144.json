An implementation error allows a\n> user to access the account of another user when they share the same\n> OpenID 2.0 provider.\n>\n> File uploads with certain extensions are not correctly processed by\n> the File API. This may lead to the creation of files that are\n> executable by Apache. The .htaccess that is saved into the files\n> directory by Drupal should normally prevent execution. The files are\n> only executable when the server is configured to ignore the directives\n> in the .htaccess file.\n>\n> Drupal doesn\\'t regenerate the session ID when an anonymous user\n> follows the one time login link used to confirm email addresses and\n> reset forgotten passwords. This enables a malicious user to fix and\n> reuse the session id of a victim under certain circumstances.\n",

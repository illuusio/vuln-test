If file system permissions allow it, this may allow\nthe attacker to overwrite important system file (if gtar is being run as\nroot), or important user configuration files such as .tcshrc or .bashrc,\nwhich would allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands.\n\n# Workaround:\n\nUse \\\"bsdtar\\\", which is the default tar implementation in FreeBSD 5.3\nand higher. For FreeBSD 4.x, bsdtar is available in the FreeBSD Ports\nCollection as ports/archivers/libarchive.\n",

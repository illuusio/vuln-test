Whether or not CAPAbilities were probed,\n>   depended on the \"auth\" option. (Fetchmail only\n>   tried CAPA if the auth option was not set at all, was set\n>   to gssapi, kerberos, kerberos\\_v4, otp, or cram-md5.)\n> * POP3 could fall back to using plain text passwords, even\n>   if strong authentication had been configured.\n> * POP2 would not complain if strong authentication or TLS\n>   had been requested.",

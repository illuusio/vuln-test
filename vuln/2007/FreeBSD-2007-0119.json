    "details": "The Drupal Project reports:\n\n> In some circumstances Drupal allows user-supplied data to become part\n> of response headers. As this user-supplied data is not always properly\n> escaped, this can be exploited by malicious users to execute HTTP\n> response splitting attacks which may lead to a variety of issues,\n> among them cache poisoning, cross-user defacement and injection of\n> arbitrary code.\n\n> The Drupal installer allows any visitor to provide credentials for a\n> database when the site\\'s own database is not reachable. This allows\n> attackers to run arbitrary code on the site\\'s server. An immediate\n> workaround is the removal of the file install.php in the Drupal root\n> directory.\n\n> The allowed extension list of the core Upload module contains the\n> extension HTML by default. Such files can be used to execute arbitrary\n> script code in the context of the affected site when a user views the\n> file. Revoking upload permissions or removing the .html extension from\n> the allowed extension list will stop uploads of malicious files. but\n> will do nothing to protect your site againstfiles that are already\n> present. Carefully inspect the file system path for any HTML files. We\n> recommend you remove any HTML file you did not update yourself. You\n> should look for , CSS includes, Javascript includes, and onerror=\\\"\\\"\n> attributes if you need to review files individually.\n\n> The Drupal Forms API protects against cross site request forgeries\n> (CSRF), where a malicious site can cause a user to unintentionally\n> submit a form to a site where he is authenticated. The user deletion\n> form does not follow the standard Forms API submission model and is\n> therefore not protected against this type of attack. A CSRF attack may\n> result in the deletion of users.\n\n> The publication status of comments is not passed during the\n> hook_comments API operation, causing various modules that rely on the\n> publication status (such as Organic groups, or Subscriptions) to mail\n> out unpublished comments.\n",

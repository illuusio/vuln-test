(Fetchmail only tried CAPA if the auth option was not set at\n>   all, was set to gssapi, kerberos, kerberos_v4, otp, or cram-md5.)\n> - POP3 could fall back to using plain text passwords, even if strong\n>   authentication had been configured.\n> - POP2 would not complain if strong authentication or TLS had been\n>   requested.\n",

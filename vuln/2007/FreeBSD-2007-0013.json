This vulnerability is in a dynamic-preprocessor\n> enabled in the default configuration, and the configuration for this\n> preprocessor allows for auto-recognition of SMB traffic to perform\n> reassembly on. No checks are performed to see if the traffic is part\n> of a valid TCP session, and multiple Write AndX requests can be\n> chained in the same TCP segment. As a result, an attacker can exploit\n> this overflow with a single TCP PDU sent across a network monitored by\n> Snort or Sourcefire.\n>\n> Snort users who cannot upgrade immediately are advised to disable the\n> DCE/RPC preprocessor by removing the DCE/RPC preprocessor directives\n> from snort.conf and restarting Snort. However, be advised that\n> disabling the DCE/RPC preprocessor reduces detection capabilities for\n> attacks in DCE/RPC traffic. After upgrading, customers should\n> re-enable the DCE/RPC preprocessor.\n",

As this user-supplied data\n> is not always properly escaped, this can be exploited by\n> malicious users to execute HTTP response splitting attacks\n> which may lead to a variety of issues, among them cache\n> poisoning, cross-user defacement and injection of arbitrary\n> code.\n\n> The Drupal installer allows any visitor to provide credentials\n> for a database when the site's own database is not reachable. This\n> allows attackers to run arbitrary code on the site's server.\n> An immediate workaround is the removal of the file install.php\n> in the Drupal root directory.\n\n> The allowed extension list of the core Upload module contains\n> the extension HTML by default. Such files can be used to execute\n> arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site when a\n> user views the file. Revoking upload permissions or removing the\n> .html extension from the allowed extension list will stop uploads\n> of malicious files. but will do nothing to protect your site\n> againstfiles that are already present. Carefully inspect the file\n> system path for any HTML files. We recommend you remove any HTML\n> file you did not update yourself. You should look for , CSS\n> includes, Javascript includes, and onerror=\"\" attributes if\n> you need to review files individually.\n\n> The Drupal Forms API protects against cross site request\n> forgeries (CSRF), where a malicious site can cause a user\n> to unintentionally submit a form to a site where he is\n> authenticated. The user deletion form does not follow the\n> standard Forms API submission model and is therefore not\n> protected against this type of attack. A CSRF attack may\n> result in the deletion of users.\n\n> The publication status of comments is not passed during the\n> hook\\_comments API operation, causing various modules that rely\n> on the publication status (such as Organic groups, or Subscriptions)\n> to mail out unpublished comments.",

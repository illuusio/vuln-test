When parsing the TIFF directory entries for certain\n> tags, the parser uses untrusted values from the file to calculate the\n> amount of memory to allocate. By providing specially crafted values,\n> an integer overflow occurs in this calculation. This results in the\n> allocation of a buffer of insufficient size, which in turn leads to a\n> heap overflow.\n",

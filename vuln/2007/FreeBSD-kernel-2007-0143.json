    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nIn the FW\\_GCROM ioctl, a signed integer comparison is used\ninstead of an unsigned integer comparison when computing the\nlength of a buffer to be copied from the kernel into the\ncalling application.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nA user in the \"operator\" group can read the contents of\nkernel memory. Such memory might contain sensitive\ninformation, such as portions of the file cache or terminal\nbuffers. This information might be directly useful, or it\nmight be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some way;\nfor example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered\npassword.\n\nWorkaround:\n===========\n\nNo workaround is available, but systems without IEEE 1394\n(\"FireWire\") interfaces are not vulnerable. (Note that\nsystems with IEEE 1394 interfaces are affected regardless of\nwhether any devices are attached.)\n\nNote also that FreeBSD does not have any non-root users in\nthe \"operator\" group by default; systems on which no users\nhave been added to this group are therefore also not\nvulnerable.",

Ts'o reports:\n\n> Fix a potential security vulnerability where an untrusted\n> filesystem can be corrupted in such a way that a program using\n> libext2fs will allocate a buffer which is far too small. This\n> can lead to either a crash or potentially a heap-based buffer\n> overflow crash. No known exploits exist, but main concern is\n> where an untrusted user who possesses privileged access in a\n> guest Xen environment could corrupt a filesystem which is then\n> accessed by thus allowing the untrusted user to gain privileged\n> access in the host OS.

This can lead to either a\n> crash or potentially a heap-based buffer overflow crash. No known\n> exploits exist, but main concern is where an untrusted user who\n> possesses privileged access in a guest Xen environment could corrupt a\n> filesystem which is then accessed by thus allowing the untrusted user\n> to gain privileged access in the host OS. Thanks to the McAfee AVERT\n> Research group for reporting this issue.\n",

    "details": "Opera Software ASA reports of multiple security fixes in Opera,\nincluding an arbitrary code execute vulnerability:\n\n> Opera for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris has a flaw in the createPattern\n> function that leaves old data that was in the memory before Opera\n> allocated it in the new pattern. The pattern can be read and analyzed\n> by JavaScript, so an attacker can get random samples of the user\\'s\n> memory, which may contain data.\n\n> Removing a specially crafted torrent from the download manager can\n> crash Opera. The crash is caused by an erroneous memory access.\n>\n> An attacker needs to entice the user to accept the malicious\n> BitTorrent download, and later remove it from Opera\\'s download\n> manager. To inject code, additional means will have to be employed.\n>\n> Users clicking a BitTorrent link and rejecting the download are not\n> affected.\n\n> data: URLs embed data inside them, instead of linking to an external\n> resource. Opera can mistakenly display the end of a data URL instead\n> of the beginning. This allows an attacker to spoof the URL of a\n> trusted site.\n\n> Opera\\'s HTTP authentication dialog is displayed when the user enters\n> a Web page that requires a login name and a password. To inform the\n> user which server it was that asked for login credentials, the dialog\n> displays the server name.\n>\n> The user has to see the entire server name. A truncated name can be\n> misleading. Opera\\'s authentication dialog cuts off the long server\n> names at the right hand side, adding an ellipsis (\\...) to indicate\n> that it has been cut off.\n>\n> The dialog has a predictable size, allowing an attacker to create a\n> server name which will look almost like a trusted site, because the\n> real domain name has been cut off. The three dots at the end will not\n> be obvious to all users.\n>\n> This flaw can be exploited by phishers who can set up custom\n> sub-domains, for example by hosting their own public DNS.\n",

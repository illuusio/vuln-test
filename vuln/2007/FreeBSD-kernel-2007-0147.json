This vulnerability is in a\n> dynamic-preprocessor enabled in the default configuration,\n> and the configuration for this preprocessor allows for\n> auto-recognition of SMB traffic to perform reassembly\n> on. No checks are performed to see if the traffic is part\n> of a valid TCP session, and multiple Write AndX requests\n> can be chained in the same TCP segment. As a result, an\n> attacker can exploit this overflow with a single TCP PDU\n> sent across a network monitored by Snort or Sourcefire.\n>\n> Snort users who cannot upgrade immediately are advised to\n> disable the DCE/RPC preprocessor by removing the DCE/RPC\n> preprocessor directives from snort.conf and restarting\n> Snort. However, be advised that disabling the DCE/RPC\n> preprocessor reduces detection capabilities for attacks in\n> DCE/RPC traffic. After upgrading, customers should\n> re-enable the DCE/RPC preprocessor.",

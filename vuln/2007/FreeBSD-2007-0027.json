The user can\n> then create accounts or effect denial of service attacks.\n>\n> This is not related to any previous CVE.\n>\n> We have coordinated with the SQL-Ledger vendor and today both of us\n> released security patches correcting the problem. SQL-Ledger users who\n> can upgrade to 2.6.26 should do so, and LedgerSMB 1.1 or 1.0 users\n> should upgrade to 1.1.9. Users who cannot upgrade should configure\n> their web servers to use http authentication for the admin.pl script\n> in the main root directory.\n",

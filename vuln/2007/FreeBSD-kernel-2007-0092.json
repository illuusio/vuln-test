    "details": "Opera Software ASA reports of multiple security fixes in\nOpera, including an arbitrary code execute\nvulnerability:\n\n> Opera for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris has a flaw in the\n> createPattern function that leaves old data that was in\n> the memory before Opera allocated it in the new\n> pattern. The pattern can be read and analyzed by\n> JavaScript, so an attacker can get random samples of the\n> user's memory, which may contain data.\n\n> Removing a specially crafted torrent from the download\n> manager can crash Opera. The crash is caused by an\n> erroneous memory access.\n>\n> An attacker needs to entice the user to accept the\n> malicious BitTorrent download, and later remove it from\n> Opera's download manager. To inject code, additional means\n> will have to be employed.\n>\n> Users clicking a BitTorrent link and rejecting the\n> download are not affected.\n\n> data: URLs embed data inside them, instead of linking to\n> an external resource. Opera can mistakenly display the end\n> of a data URL instead of the beginning. This allows an\n> attacker to spoof the URL of a trusted site.\n\n> Opera's HTTP authentication dialog is displayed when the\n> user enters a Web page that requires a login name and a\n> password. To inform the user which server it was that\n> asked for login credentials, the dialog displays the\n> server name.\n>\n> The user has to see the entire server name. A truncated\n> name can be misleading. Opera's authentication dialog cuts\n> off the long server names at the right hand side, adding\n> an ellipsis (...) to indicate that it has been cut off.\n>\n> The dialog has a predictable size, allowing an attacker\n> to create a server name which will look almost like a\n> trusted site, because the real domain name has been cut\n> off. The three dots at the end will not be obvious to all\n> users.\n>\n> This flaw can be exploited by phishers who can set up\n> custom sub-domains, for example by hosting their own\n> public DNS.",

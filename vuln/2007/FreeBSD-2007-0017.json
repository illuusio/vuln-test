    "details": "# Problem Description:\n\nIn the FW_GCROM ioctl, a signed integer comparison is used instead of an\nunsigned integer comparison when computing the length of a buffer to be\ncopied from the kernel into the calling application.\n\n# Impact:\n\nA user in the \\\"operator\\\" group can read the contents of kernel memory.\nSuch memory might contain sensitive information, such as portions of the\nfile cache or terminal buffers. This information might be directly\nuseful, or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some\nway; for example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered\npassword.\n\n# Workaround:\n\nNo workaround is available, but systems without IEEE 1394 (\\\"FireWire\\\")\ninterfaces are not vulnerable. (Note that systems with IEEE 1394\ninterfaces are affected regardless of whether any devices are attached.)\n\nNote also that FreeBSD does not have any non-root users in the\n\\\"operator\\\" group by default; systems on which no users have been added\nto this group are therefore also not vulnerable.\n",

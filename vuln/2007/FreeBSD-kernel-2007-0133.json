The problem is caused\n> by the password checking routine failing to enforce a\n> password check under certain circumstances. The user\n> can then create accounts or effect denial of service\n> attacks.\n>\n> This is not related to any previous CVE.\n>\n> We have coordinated with the SQL-Ledger vendor and\n> today both of us released security patches correcting\n> the problem. SQL-Ledger users who can upgrade to 2.6.26\n> should do so, and LedgerSMB 1.1 or 1.0 users should\n> upgrade to 1.1.9. Users who cannot upgrade should\n> configure their web servers to use http authentication\n> for the admin.pl script in the main root directory.",

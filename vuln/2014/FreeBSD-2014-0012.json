This vulnerability is assigned\n> CVE-2014-1474.\n>\n> This vulnerability is caused by poor parsing performance in the\n> Email::Address::List module, which RT depends on. We recommend that\n> affected users upgrade their version of Email::Address::List to v0.02\n> or above, which resolves the issue. Due to a communications mishap,\n> the release on CPAN will temporarily appear as \\\"unauthorized,\\\" and\n> the command-line cpan client will hence not install it. We expect this\n> to be resolved shortly; in the meantime, the release is also available\n> from our server.\n",

An attacker can use all available file descriptors\n> using SIP INVITE requests. Asterisk will respond with code 400, 420,\n> or 422 for INVITEs meeting this criteria.

The file\n> descriptors cannot be released without restarting Asterisk which may\n> allow intrusion detection systems to be bypassed by sending the\n> requests slowly.\n>\n> Remote Crash Vulnerability in PJSIP channel driver. A remotely\n> exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the PJSIP channel driver if\n> the \\\"qualify_frequency\\\" configuration option is enabled on an AOR\n> and the remote SIP server challenges for authentication of the\n> resulting OPTIONS request.

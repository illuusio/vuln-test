    "details": "Kohsuke Kawaguchi from Jenkins team reports:\n\n> Historically, Jenkins master and slaves behaved as if\n> they altogether form a single distributed process. This\n> means a slave can ask a master to do just about anything\n> within the confinement of the operating system, such as\n> accessing files on the master or trigger other jobs on\n> Jenkins.\n>\n> This has increasingly become problematic, as larger\n> enterprise deployments have developed more sophisticated\n> trust separation model, where the administators of a master\n> might take slaves owned by other teams. In such an\n> environment, slaves are less trusted than the master.\n> Yet the \"single distributed process\" assumption was not\n> communicated well to the users, resulting in vulnerabilities\n> in some deployments.\n>\n> SECURITY-144 (CVE-2014-3665) introduces a new subsystem\n> to address this problem. This feature is off by default for\n> compatibility reasons. See Wiki for more details, who should\n> turn this on, and implications.\n>\n> CVE-2014-3566 is rated high. It only affects\n> installations that accept slaves from less trusted\n> computers, but this will allow an owner of of such slave to\n> mount a remote code execution attack on Jenkins.",

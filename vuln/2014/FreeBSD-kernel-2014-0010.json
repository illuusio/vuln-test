This can cause a denial of service\n> (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited\n> to achieve arbitrary code execution.\n>\n> The GLX extension to the X Window System allows an X client\n> to send X protocol to the X server, to request that the X\n> server perform OpenGL rendering on behalf of the X client.\n> This is known as \"GLX indirect rendering\", as opposed to\n> \"GLX direct rendering\" where the X client submits OpenGL\n> rendering commands directly to the GPU, bypassing the X\n> server and avoiding the X server code for GLX protocol\n> handling.\n>\n> Most GLX indirect rendering implementations share some\n> common ancestry, dating back to \"Sample Implementation\"\n> code from Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI), which SGI\n> originally commercially licensed to other Unix workstation\n> and graphics vendors, and later released as open source, so\n> those vulnerabilities may affect other licensees of SGI's\n> code base beyond those running code from the X.Org Foundation\n> or the XFree86 Project.",

This allows a hacker to run any arbitrary command as root\n> under the guise of updating the time.\n>\n> An application can gain root priveledges from an admin user with\n> either misleading information or no interaction.\n>\n> On some systems the user will be shown a prompt to change the\n> time. However, if the system has policykit-desktop-privileges\n> installed, the datetime helper will be invoked by an admin user\n> without any prompts.",

    "details": "Kohsuke Kawaguchi from Jenkins team reports:\n\n> Historically, Jenkins master and slaves behaved as if they altogether\n> form a single distributed process. This means a slave can ask a master\n> to do just about anything within the confinement of the operating\n> system, such as accessing files on the master or trigger other jobs on\n> Jenkins.\n>\n> This has increasingly become problematic, as larger enterprise\n> deployments have developed more sophisticated trust separation model,\n> where the administators of a master might take slaves owned by other\n> teams. In such an environment, slaves are less trusted than the\n> master. Yet the \\\"single distributed process\\\" assumption was not\n> communicated well to the users, resulting in vulnerabilities in some\n> deployments.\n>\n> SECURITY-144 (CVE-2014-3665) introduces a new subsystem to address\n> this problem. This feature is off by default for compatibility\n> reasons. See Wiki for more details, who should turn this on, and\n> implications.\n>\n> CVE-2014-3566 is rated high. It only affects installations that accept\n> slaves from less trusted computers, but this will allow an owner of of\n> such slave to mount a remote code execution attack on Jenkins.\n",

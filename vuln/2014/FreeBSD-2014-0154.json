If a payload length of zero was received the code\n> would incorrectly attempt to resize to zero. This operation would\n> succeed and end up freeing the memory but be treated as a failure.\n> When the session was subsequently torn down this memory would get\n> freed yet again causing a crash.\n>\n> Users of the WebSocket functionality also did not take into account\n> that provided text frames are not guaranteed to be NULL terminated.\n> This has been fixed in chan_sip and chan_pjsip in the applicable\n> versions.\n",

This code is commonly called from the\n> X server when an X Font Server is active in the font path, so may be\n> running in a setuid-root process depending on the X server in use.\n> Exploits of this path could be used by a local, authenticated user to\n> attempt to raise privileges; or by a remote attacker who can control\n> the font server to attempt to execute code with the privileges of the\n> X server.\n",

This vulnerability is assigned\n> CVE-2014-1474.\n>\n> This vulnerability is caused by poor parsing performance\n> in the Email::Address::List module, which RT depends on. We\n> recommend that affected users upgrade their version of\n> Email::Address::List to v0.02 or above, which resolves the\n> issue. Due to a communications mishap, the release on CPAN\n> will temporarily appear as \"unauthorized,\" and the\n> command-line cpan client will hence not install it. We\n> expect this to be resolved shortly; in the meantime, the\n> release is also available from our server.",

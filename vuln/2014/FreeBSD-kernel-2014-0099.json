This code is commonly\n> called from the X server when an X Font Server is active in the\n> font path, so may be running in a setuid-root process depending\n> on the X server in use. Exploits of this path could be used by\n> a local, authenticated user to attempt to raise privileges; or\n> by a remote attacker who can control the font server to attempt\n> to execute code with the privileges of the X server.",

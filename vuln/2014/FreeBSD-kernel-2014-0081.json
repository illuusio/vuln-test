A malicious process could\n> force system services or user applications to be disconnected\n> from the D-Bus system bus by sending them a message containing\n> a file descriptor, then causing that file descriptor to exceed\n> the kernel's maximum recursion depth (itself introduced to fix\n> a DoS) before dbus-daemon forwards the message to the victim\n> process. Most services and applications exit when disconnected\n> from the system bus, leading to a denial of service.\n>\n> Additionally, Alban discovered that bug fd.o#79694, a bug\n> previously reported by Alejandro Mart\u00ednez Su\u00e1rez which was n\n> believed to be security flaw, could be used for a similar denial\n> of service, by causing dbus-daemon to attempt to forward invalid\n> file descriptors to a victim process when file descriptors become\n> associated with the wrong message.",

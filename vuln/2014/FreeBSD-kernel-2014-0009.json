When\n> the session was subsequently torn down this memory would\n> get freed yet again causing a crash.\n>\n> Users of the WebSocket functionality also did not take\n> into account that provided text frames are not guaranteed\n> to be NULL terminated. This has been fixed in chan\\_sip\n> and chan\\_pjsip in the applicable versions.",

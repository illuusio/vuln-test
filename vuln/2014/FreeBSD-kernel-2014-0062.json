In particular\n> this means that '\\*' is not limited to a single label within a hostname\n> (i.e. it will match '.'). But even further apr\\_fnmatch supports '?' and\n> character classes (neither of which are part of the RFCs defining how\n> certificate validation works).\n>\n> Subversion stores cached credentials by an MD5 hash based on the URL and\n> the authentication realm of the server the credentials are cached for.\n> MD5 has been shown to be subject to chosen plaintext hash collisions.\n> This means it may be possible to generate an authentication realm which\n> results in the same MD5 hash for a different URL.",

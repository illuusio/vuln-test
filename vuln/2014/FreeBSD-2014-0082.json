A malicious process could force\n> system services or user applications to be disconnected from the D-Bus\n> system bus by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,\n> then causing that file descriptor to exceed the kernel\\'s maximum\n> recursion depth (itself introduced to fix a DoS) before dbus-daemon\n> forwards the message to the victim process. Most services and\n> applications exit when disconnected from the system bus, leading to a\n> denial of service.\n>\n> Additionally, Alban discovered that bug fd.o#79694, a bug previously\n> reported by Alejandro Mart\u00ednez Su\u00e1rez which was n believed to be\n> security flaw, could be used for a similar denial of service, by\n> causing dbus-daemon to attempt to forward invalid file descriptors to\n> a victim process when file descriptors become associated with the\n> wrong message.\n",

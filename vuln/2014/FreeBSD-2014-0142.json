All previous releases are not\n> affected. Upgrading to this release from 1.1.14 is very safe and will\n> not break your existing code.\n>\n> The vulnerability is in the CDetailView widget. When a Yii application\n> uses this widget and configures the \\\"value\\\" property of a\n> CDetailView attribute using end user inputs, it may allow attackers to\n> potentially execute arbitrary PHP scripts on the server. We are not\n> showing how to exploit it here to allow users to upgrade before\n> details about the exploit become publicly known. To our knowledge the\n> details of this issue are only known to core team members.\n",

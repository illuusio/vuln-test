This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server\n> segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code\n> execution.\n>\n> The GLX extension to the X Window System allows an X client to send X\n> protocol to the X server, to request that the X server perform OpenGL\n> rendering on behalf of the X client. This is known as \\\"GLX indirect\n> rendering\\\", as opposed to \\\"GLX direct rendering\\\" where the X client\n> submits OpenGL rendering commands directly to the GPU, bypassing the X\n> server and avoiding the X server code for GLX protocol handling.\n>\n> Most GLX indirect rendering implementations share some common\n> ancestry, dating back to \\\"Sample Implementation\\\" code from Silicon\n> Graphics, Inc (SGI), which SGI originally commercially licensed to\n> other Unix workstation and graphics vendors, and later released as\n> open source, so those vulnerabilities may affect other licensees of\n> SGI\\'s code base beyond those running code from the X.Org Foundation\n> or the XFree86 Project.\n",

If a kpropd worker process receives invalid\n> input that causes it to exit with an abnormal status, it can\n> cause the termination of the listening process that spawned it,\n> preventing the slave KDC it was running on from receiving\n> database updates from the master KDC.\n>\n> Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are\n> easy to trigger manually.\n>\n> An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause kpropd running in\n> standalone mode (the \"-S\" option) to terminate its listening\n> process, preventing database propagations to the KDC host on\n> which it was running. Configurations where kpropd runs in\n> incremental propagation mode (\"iprop\") or as an inetd server\n> are not affected.",

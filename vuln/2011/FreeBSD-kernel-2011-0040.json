    "details": "CERT-FI reports:\n\n> Five vulnerabilities have been found in the BGP, OSPF, and\n> OSPFv3 components of Quagga. The vulnerabilities allow an\n> attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially to\n> execute his own code by sending a specially modified packets\n> to an affected server. Routing messages are typically accepted\n> from the routing peers. Exploiting these vulnerabilities may\n> require an established routing session (BGP peering or\n> OSPF/OSPFv3 adjacency) to the router.\n>\n> The vulnerability [CVE-2011-3327](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3327)\n> is related to the extended communities handling in BGP\n> messages. Receiving a malformed BGP update can result\n> in a buffer overflow and disruption of IPv4 routing.\n>\n> The vulnerability [CVE-2011-3326](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3326)\n> results from the handling of LSA (Link State Advertisement)\n> states in the OSPF service. Receiving a modified Link State\n> Update message with malicious state information can result in\n> denial of service in IPv4 routing.\n>\n> The vulnerability [CVE-2011-3325](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3325)\n> is a denial of service vulnerability related to Hello message\n> handling by the OSPF service. As Hello messages are used to\n> initiate adjacencies, exploiting the vulnerability may be\n> feasible from the same broadcast domain without an established\n> adjacency. A malformed packet may result in denial of service\n> in IPv4 routing.\n>\n> The vulnerabilities [CVE-2011-3324](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3324)\n> and [CVE-2011-3323](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3323)\n> are related to the IPv6 routing protocol (OSPFv3) implemented\n> in ospf6d daemon. Receiving modified Database Description and\n> Link State Update messages, respectively, can result in denial\n> of service in IPv6 routing.",

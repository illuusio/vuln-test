This can cause\n> the daemon to crash or induce the execution of arbitrary code\n> (which is believed to be difficult). No exploit that executes\n> arbitrary code is known to exist, but it is easy to trigger a\n> denial of service manually.\n>\n> Some platforms detect attempted freeing of invalid pointers and\n> protectively terminate the process, preventing arbitrary code\n> execution on those platforms.",

This\n> allowed for information disclosure.\n\nAlso, impact assessment was redone shortly after the original\nannouncement:\n\n> Further analysis revealed that the second security was\n> more severe than I realised at the time that I wrote the\n> announcement. The second security issue has been assigned\n> CVE-2011-1407 and is also a remote code execution flaw.\n> For clarity: both issues were introduced with 4.70.",

This allowed for information\n> disclosure.\n\nAlso, impact assessment was redone shortly after the original\nannouncement:\n\n> Further analysis revealed that the second security was more severe\n> than I realised at the time that I wrote the announcement. The second\n> security issue has been assigned CVE-2011-1407 and is also a remote\n> code execution flaw. For clarity: both issues were introduced with\n> 4.70.\n",

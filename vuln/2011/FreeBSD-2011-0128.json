The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to cause a\n> denial of service or potentially to execute his own code by sending a\n> specially modified packets to an affected server. Routing messages are\n> typically accepted from the routing peers. Exploiting these\n> vulnerabilities may require an established routing session (BGP\n> peering or OSPF/OSPFv3 adjacency) to the router.\n>\n> The vulnerability\n> [CVE-2011-3327](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3327) is\n> related to the extended communities handling in BGP messages.\n> Receiving a malformed BGP update can result in a buffer overflow and\n> disruption of IPv4 routing.\n>\n> The vulnerability\n> [CVE-2011-3326](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3326)\n> results from the handling of LSA (Link State Advertisement) states in\n> the OSPF service. Receiving a modified Link State Update message with\n> malicious state information can result in denial of service in IPv4\n> routing.\n>\n> The vulnerability\n> [CVE-2011-3325](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3325) is\n> a denial of service vulnerability related to Hello message handling by\n> the OSPF service. As Hello messages are used to initiate adjacencies,\n> exploiting the vulnerability may be feasible from the same broadcast\n> domain without an established adjacency. A malformed packet may result\n> in denial of service in IPv4 routing.\n>\n> The vulnerabilities\n> [CVE-2011-3324](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3324) and\n> [CVE-2011-3323](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3323) are\n> related to the IPv6 routing protocol (OSPFv3) implemented in ospf6d\n> daemon.

The people affected were primarily located\n> in Iran. The attacker used a fraudulent SSL certificate issued by\n> DigiNotar, a root certificate authority that should not issue\n> certificates for Google (and has since revoked it). \\[\\...\\]\n\nVASCO Data Security International Inc., owner of DigiNotar, issued a\npress statement confirming this incident:\n\n> On July 19th 2011, DigiNotar detected an intrusion into its\n> Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure, which resulted in the\n> fraudulent issuance of public key certificate requests for a number of\n> domains, including Google.com. \\[\\...\\] an external security audit\n> concluded that all fraudulently issued certificates were revoked.\n> Recently, it was discovered that at least one fraudulent certificate\n> had not been revoked at the time. \\[\\...\\]\n\nMozilla, maintainer of the NSS package, from which FreeBSD derived\nca_root_nss, stated that they:\n\n> revoked our trust in the DigiNotar certificate authority from all\n> Mozilla software. This is not a temporary suspension, it is a complete\n> removal from our trusted root program. Complete revocation of trust is\n> a decision we treat with careful consideration, and employ as a last\n> resort.\n>\n> Three central issues informed our decision:\n>\n> 1.  Failure to notify. \\[\\...\\]\n> 2.  The scope of the breach remains unknown. \\[\\...\\]\n> 3.  The attack is not theoretical.\n",

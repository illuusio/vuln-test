If a\n> kpropd worker process receives invalid input that causes it to exit\n> with an abnormal status, it can cause the termination of the listening\n> process that spawned it, preventing the slave KDC it was running on\n> from receiving database updates from the master KDC.\n>\n> Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are easy\n> to trigger manually.\n>\n> An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause kpropd running in\n> standalone mode (the \\\"-S\\\" option) to terminate its listening\n> process, preventing database propagations to the KDC host on which it\n> was running. Configurations where kpropd runs in incremental\n> propagation mode (\\\"iprop\\\") or as an inetd server are not affected.\n",

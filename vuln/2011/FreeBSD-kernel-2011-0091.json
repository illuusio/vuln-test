The CGI program mishandles untrusted data when\n> printing responses to the browser. This makes the program\n> vulnerable to carefully crafted requests containing script\n> or HTML. If an attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to\n> visit carefully staged content, the attacker can use it to\n> redirect the user to his or her local Pubcookie login page\n> and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerability.",

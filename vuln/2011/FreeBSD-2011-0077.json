The CGI\n> program mishandles untrusted data when printing responses to the\n> browser. This makes the program vulnerable to carefully crafted\n> requests containing script or HTML. If an attacker can lure an\n> unsuspecting user to visit carefully staged content, the attacker can\n> use it to redirect the user to his or her local Pubcookie login page\n> and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerability.\n",

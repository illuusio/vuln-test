The people affected were\n> primarily located in Iran. The attacker used a fraudulent SSL\n> certificate issued by DigiNotar, a root certificate authority that\n> should not issue certificates for Google (and has since revoked\n> it). [...]\n\nVASCO Data Security International Inc., owner of DigiNotar, issued a\npress statement confirming this incident:\n\n> On July 19th 2011, DigiNotar detected an intrusion\n> into its Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure, which resulted\n> in the fraudulent issuance of public key certificate requests for\n> a number of domains, including Google.com. [...] an external\n> security audit concluded that all fraudulently issued certificates\n> were\n> revoked. Recently, it was discovered that at least one fraudulent\n> certificate had not been revoked at the time. [...]\n\nMozilla, maintainer of the NSS package, from which FreeBSD derived\nca\\_root\\_nss, stated that they:\n\n> revoked our trust in the DigiNotar certificate authority from\n> all Mozilla software. This is not a temporary suspension, it is\n> a complete removal from our trusted root program. Complete\n> revocation of trust is a decision we treat with careful\n> consideration, and employ as a last resort.\n>\n> Three central issues informed our decision:\n>\n> 1. Failure to notify. [...]\n> 2. The scope of the breach remains unknown. [...]\n> 3. The attack is not theoretical.",

However, the actual\n> S(TART)TLS-initiated in-band SSL/TLS negotiation was not guarded by a\n> timeout.\n>\n> Depending on the operating system defaults as to TCP stream keepalive\n> mode, fetchmail hangs in excess of one week after sending STARTTLS\n> were observed if the connection failed without notifying the operating\n> system, for instance, through network outages or hard server crashes.\n>\n> A malicious server that does not respond, at the network level, after\n> acknowledging fetchmail\\'s STARTTLS or STLS request, can hold\n> fetchmail in this protocol state, and thus render fetchmail unable to\n> complete the poll, or proceed to the next server, effecting a denial\n> of service.\n>\n> SSL-wrapped mode on dedicated ports was unaffected by this problem, so\n> can be used as a workaround.\n",

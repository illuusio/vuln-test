    "details": "Colton Myers reports:\n\n> In order to fix potential shell injection vulnerabilities in salt\n> modules, a change has been made to the various cmd module functions.\n> These functions now default to python\\_shell=False, which means that\n> the commands will not be sent to an actual shell.\n>\n> The largest side effect of this change is that \"shellisms\", such as\n> pipes, will not work by default. The modules shipped with salt have\n> been audited to fix any issues that might have arisen from this\n> change. Additionally, the cmd state module has been unaffected, and\n> use of cmd.run in jinja is also unaffected. cmd.run calls on the\n> CLI will also allow shellisms.\n>\n> However, custom execution modules which use shellisms in cmd calls\n> will break, unless you pass python\\_shell=True to these calls.\n>\n> As a temporary workaround, you can set cmd\\_safe: False in your\n> minion and master configs. This will revert the default, but is\n> also less secure, as it will allow shell injection vulnerabilities\n> to be written in custom code. We recommend you only set this\n> setting for as long as it takes to resolve these issues in your\n> custom code, then remove the override.",

See below for a\n> list.\n>\n> ### Cross-site Scripting - Ajax system - Drupal 7\n>\n> A vulnerability was found that allows a malicious user to perform a\n> cross-site scripting attack by invoking Drupal.ajax() on a whitelisted\n> HTML element.\n>\n> This vulnerability is mitigated on sites that do not allow untrusted\n> users to enter HTML.\n>\n> ### Cross-site Scripting - Autocomplete system - Drupal 6 and 7\n>\n> A cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the autocomplete\n> functionality of forms. The requested URL is not sufficiently\n> sanitized.\n>\n> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the malicious user\n> must be allowed to upload files.\n>\n> ### SQL Injection - Database API - Drupal 7\n>\n> A vulnerability was found in the SQL comment filtering system which\n> could allow a user with elevated permissions to inject malicious code\n> in SQL comments.\n>\n> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only one contributed\n> module that the security team found uses the comment filtering system\n> in a way that would trigger the vulnerability. That module requires\n> you to have a very high level of access in order to perform the\n> attack.\n>\n> ### Cross-site Request Forgery - Form API - Drupal 6 and 7\n>\n> A vulnerability was discovered in Drupal\\'s form API that could allow\n> file upload value callbacks to run with untrusted input, due to form\n> token validation not being performed early enough. This vulnerability\n> could allow a malicious user to upload files to the site under another\n> user\\'s account.\n>\n> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the uploaded files\n> would be temporary, and Drupal normally deletes temporary files\n> automatically after 6 hours.\n>\n> ### Information Disclosure in Menu Links - Access system - Drupal 6 and 7\n>\n> Users without the \\\"access content\\\" permission can see the titles of\n> nodes that they do not have access to, if the nodes are added to a\n> menu on the site that the users have access to.\n",

An obvious example of this\n> is the password typed during SSH login; other examples include\n> obsolete session keys, public-key passphrases, and the private\n> halves of public keys.\n>\n> PuTTY 0.63 and earlier versions, after loading a private key\n> from a disk file, mistakenly leak a memory buffer containing a\n> copy of the private key, in the function ssh2\\_load\\_userkey. The\n> companion function ssh2\\_save\\_userkey (only called by PuTTYgen) can\n> also leak a copy, but only in the case where the file it tried to\n> save to could not be created.",

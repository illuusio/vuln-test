Many programs allow some\n> kind of external sources to set the URL or provide partial pieces for\n> the URL to ask for, and if the URL as received from the user is not\n> stripped good enough this flaw allows malicious users to do additional\n> requests in a way that was not intended, or just to insert request\n> headers into the request that the program didn\\'t intend.

CVE-2015-7519 has been\n> assigned to this issue.\n>\n> Affected use-cases:\n>\n> Header overwriting may occur if all of the following conditions are\n> met:\n>\n> - Apache integration mode, or standalone+builtin engine without a\n>   filtering proxy\n> - Ruby or Python applications only (Passenger 5); or any application\n>   (Passenger 4)\n> - The app depends on a request header containing a dash (-)\n> - The header is supposed to be trusted (set by the server)\n> - The client correctly guesses the header name\n>\n> This vulnerability has been fixed by filtering out client headers that\n> do not consist of alphanumeric/dash characters (Nginx already did\n> this, so Passenger+Nginx was not affected). If your application\n> depends on headers that don\\'t conform to this, you can add a\n> workaround in Apache specifically for those to convert them to a\n> dash-based format.\n",

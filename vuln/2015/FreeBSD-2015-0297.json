In the best case this leads to wrong\n> TLS extensions being used for the client, worst-case a crash of the\n> proxy terminating all active transactions.\n>\n> Incorrect message size checks and assumptions about the existence of\n> TLS extensions in the SSL/TLS handshake message can lead to very high\n> CPU consumption (up to and including \\'infinite loop\\' behaviour).\n>\n> The above can be triggered remotely. Though there is one layer of\n> authorization applied before this processing to check that the client\n> is allowed to use the proxy, that check is generally weak. MS Skype on\n> Windows XP is known to trigger some of these.\n\nThe FreeBSD port does not use SSL by default and is not vulnerable in\nthe default configuration.\n",

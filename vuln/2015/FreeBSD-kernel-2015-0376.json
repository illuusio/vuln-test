This vulnerability can be used to attack Jenkins inside\n> firewalls from outside so long as the location of Jenkins is known\n> to the attacker.\n>\n> ##### SECURITY-180 (forced API token change)\n>\n> The part of Jenkins that issues a new API token was not\n> adequately protected against anonymous attackers. This allows an\n> attacker to escalate privileges on Jenkins.",

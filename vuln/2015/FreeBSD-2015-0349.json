Additionally, OpenAFS Rx in\n> versions 1.5.75 through 1.5.78, 1.6.0 through 1.6.14, and 1.7.0\n> through 1.7.32 include a variable-length padding at the end of the ACK\n> packet, in an attempt to detect the path MTU, but only four octets of\n> the additional padding are initialized (CVE-2015-7763).\n",

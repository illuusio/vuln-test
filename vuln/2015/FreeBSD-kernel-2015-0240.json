This means that such accesses can similarly lead to\n> Unsupported Request responses until these flags are set as needed by\n> the guest.\n>\n> In the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses\n> as Non-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat\n> NMIs as fatal or (e.g. via ACPI's APEI) the platform tells the OS to\n> treat these errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a\n> Denial of Service.",

For a PuTTY SSH session, this must be before\n> encryption, so the attacker likely needs access to the server you\\'re\n> connecting to. For instance, an attacker on a multi-user machine that\n> you connect to could trick you into running cat on a file they control\n> containing a malicious escape sequence. (Unix write(1) is not a vector\n> for this, if implemented correctly.)\n>\n> Only PuTTY, PuTTYtel, and pterm are affected; other PuTTY tools do not\n> include the terminal emulator, so cannot be exploited this way.\n",

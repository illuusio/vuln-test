These requests could cause data loss\n> or compromise.\n>\n> Remediation Summary: Users should either set \\\"http.cors.enabled\\\" to\n> false, or set \\\"http.cors.allow-origin\\\" to the value of the server\n> that should be allowed access, such as localhost or a server hosting\n> Kibana. Disabling CORS entirely with the former setting is more\n> secure, but may not be suitable for all use cases.\n",

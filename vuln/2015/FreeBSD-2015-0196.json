As a result,\n> the subsequent code behaved as if version 2 was in use, when a guest\n> issued this hypercall without a prior GNTTABOP_setup_table or\n> GNTTABOP_set_version.\n>\n> The effect is a possible NULL pointer dereferences. However, this\n> cannot be exploited to elevate privileges of the attacking domain, as\n> the maximum memory address that can be wrongly accessed this way is\n> bounded to far below the start of hypervisor memory.\n>\n> Malicious or buggy guest domain kernels can mount a denial of service\n> attack which, if successful, can affect the whole system.\n",

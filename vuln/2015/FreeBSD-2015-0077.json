This was reported by Cedric Van Bockhaven and\n> fixed by Gary Pendergast, Mike Adams, and Andrew Nacin of the\n> WordPress security team.\n>\n> We also fixed three other security issues:\n>\n> - In WordPress 4.1 and higher, files with invalid or unsafe names\n>   could be uploaded. Discovered by Michael Kapfer and Sebastian\n>   Kraemer of HSASec.\n> - In WordPress 3.9 and higher, a very limited cross-site scripting\n>   vulnerability could be used as part of a social engineering attack.\n>   Discovered by Jakub Zoczek.\n> - Some plugins were vulnerable to an SQL injection vulnerability.\n>   Discovered by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.\n>\n> We also made four hardening changes, discovered by J.D.

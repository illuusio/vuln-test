An obvious example of this is the\n> password typed during SSH login; other examples include obsolete\n> session keys, public-key passphrases, and the private halves of public\n> keys.\n>\n> PuTTY 0.63 and earlier versions, after loading a private key from a\n> disk file, mistakenly leak a memory buffer containing a copy of the\n> private key, in the function ssh2_load_userkey. The companion function\n> ssh2_save_userkey (only called by PuTTYgen) can also leak a copy, but\n> only in the case where the file it tried to save to could not be\n> created.\n",

The modules shipped with salt have\n> been audited to fix any issues that might have arisen from this\n> change. Additionally, the cmd state module has been unaffected, and\n> use of cmd.run in jinja is also unaffected. cmd.run calls on the CLI\n> will also allow shellisms.\n>\n> However, custom execution modules which use shellisms in cmd calls\n> will break, unless you pass python_shell=True to these calls.\n>\n> As a temporary workaround, you can set cmd_safe: False in your minion\n> and master configs. This will revert the default, but is also less\n> secure, as it will allow shell injection vulnerabilities to be written\n> in custom code. We recommend you only set this setting for as long as\n> it takes to resolve these issues in your custom code, then remove the\n> override.\n",

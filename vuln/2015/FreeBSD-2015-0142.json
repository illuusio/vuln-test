But it will also\n> pass the spoof check, because a file named .html and containing actual\n> HTML passes the spoof check.\n>\n> This change makes it so that we also check the supplied content type.\n> So even if the file contains HTML and ends with .html, it doesn\\'t\n> match the content type of \\`image/jpeg\\` and so it fails.\n",

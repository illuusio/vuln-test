The GNTTABOP\\_swap\\_grant\\_ref call was lacking such a\n> check. As a result, the subsequent code behaved as if version 2 was\n> in use, when a guest issued this hypercall without a prior\n> GNTTABOP\\_setup\\_table or GNTTABOP\\_set\\_version.\n>\n> The effect is a possible NULL pointer dereferences. However, this\n> cannot be exploited to elevate privileges of the attacking domain,\n> as the maximum memory address that can be wrongly accessed this way\n> is bounded to far below the start of hypervisor memory.\n>\n> Malicious or buggy guest domain kernels can mount a denial of\n> service attack which, if successful, can affect the whole system.",

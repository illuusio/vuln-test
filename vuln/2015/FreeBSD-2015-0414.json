Note that the\n> virStoragePoolListVolumes API, when used on a storage pool backed by a\n> directory in a file system, will only list volumes immediately in that\n> directory (there is no traversal into subdirectories). However, other\n> APIs such as virStorageVolCreateXML were not checking if a potential\n> volume name represented one of the volumes that could be returned by\n> virStoragePoolListVolumes; because they were not rejecting the use of\n> \\'/\\' in a volume name.\n>\n> Because no checking was done on volume names, a user could supply a\n> potential volume name of something like \\'../../../etc/passwd\\' to\n> attempt to access a file not belonging to the storage pool. When\n> fine-grained Access Control Lists (ACL) are in effect, a user with\n> storage_vol:create ACL permission but lacking domain:write permission\n> could thus abuse virStorageVolCreateXML and similar APIs to gain\n> access to files not normally permitted to that user. Fortunately, it\n> appears that the only APIs that could leak information or corrupt\n> files require read-write connection to libvirtd; and when ACLs are not\n> in use (the default without any further configuration), a user with\n> read-write access can already be considered to have full access to the\n> machine, and without an escalation of privilege there is no security\n> problem.\n",

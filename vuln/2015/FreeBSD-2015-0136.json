Under certain circumstances, malicious\n> users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users\n> into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the\n> users to potential social engineering attacks.\n>\n> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only sites with the\n> Field UI module enabled are affected.\n>\n> Drupal 6 core is not affected, but see the similar advisory for the\n> Drupal 6 contributed CCK module:\n> [SA-CONTRIB-2015-126](https://www.drupal.org/node/2507753)\n>\n> ### Open redirect (Overlay module - Drupal 7 - Less critical)\n>\n> The Overlay module displays administrative pages as a layer over the\n> current page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing the page in the\n> browser window. The Overlay module does not sufficiently validate URLs\n> prior to displaying their contents, leading to an open redirect\n> vulnerability.\n>\n> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only be used\n> against site users who have the \\\"Access the administrative overlay\\\"\n> permission, and that the Overlay module must be enabled.\n>\n> ### Information disclosure (Render cache system - Drupal 7 - Less critical)\n>\n> On sites utilizing Drupal 7\\'s render cache system to cache content on\n> the site by user role, private content viewed by user 1 may be\n> included in the cache and exposed to non-privileged users.\n>\n> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that render caching is not\n> used in Drupal 7 core itself (it requires custom code or the\n> contributed [Render\n> Cache](https://www.drupal.org/project/render_cache) module to enable)\n> and that it only affects sites that have user 1 browsing the live\n> site. Exposure is also limited if an administrative role has been\n> assigned to the user 1 account (which is done, for example, by the\n> Standard install profile that ships with Drupal core).\n",

Jenkins now sends\n> Content-Security-Policy headers that enables sandboxing and\n> prohibits script execution by default.\n>\n> ##### SECURITY-225 / CVE-2015-7537 (CSRF vulnerability in some administrative actions)\n>\n> Several administration/configuration related URLs could be\n> accessed using GET, which allowed attackers to circumvent CSRF\n> protection.\n>\n> ##### SECURITY-233 / CVE-2015-7538 (CSRF protection ineffective)\n>\n> Malicious users were able to circumvent CSRF protection on any\n> URL by sending specially crafted POST requests.\n>\n> ##### SECURITY-234 / CVE-2015-7539 (Jenkins plugin manager vulnerable to MITM attacks)\n>\n> While the Jenkins update site data is digitally signed, and the\n> signature verified by Jenkins, Jenkins did not verify the provided\n> SHA-1 checksums for the plugin files referenced in the update site\n> data. This enabled MITM attacks on the plugin manager, resulting\n> in installation of attacker-provided plugins.",

The treatment of such errors is platform specific.\n>\n> Furthermore (at least) devices under control of the Linux pciback\n> driver in the host are handed to guests with the aforementioned bits\n> turned off. This means that such accesses can similarly lead to\n> Unsupported Request responses until these flags are set as needed by\n> the guest.\n>\n> In the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses as\n> Non-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat NMIs\n> as fatal or (e.g. via ACPI\\'s APEI) the platform tells the OS to treat\n> these errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a Denial of\n> Service.\n",

SECURITY FIX: When constructing paths of objects being archived, a\n> buffer could overflow by one byte upon encountering 1024, 2048, 4096,\n> etc. byte paths. Theoretically this could be exploited by an\n> unprivileged user whose files are being archived; I do not believe it\n> is exploitable in practice, but I am offering a \\$1000 bounty for the\n> first person who can prove me wrong:\n> http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2015-08-21-tarsnap-1000-exploit-bounty.html\n>\n> 2\\. SECURITY FIX: An attacker with a machine\\'s write keys, or with\n> read keys and control of the tarsnap service, could make tarsnap\n> allocate a large amount of memory upon listing archives or reading an\n> archive the attacker created; on 32-bit machines, tarsnap can be\n> caused to crash under the aforementioned conditions.\n",

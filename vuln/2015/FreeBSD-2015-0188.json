Other toolstacks\n> may be vulnerable however.\n>\n> The vulnerability is exposed via HVM guests which have a PCI device\n> assigned to them. A malicious HVM guest in such a configuration can\n> mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system via its\n> associated device model (qemu-dm).\n>\n> A guest is able to trigger this hypercall via operations which it is\n> legitimately expected to perform, therefore running the device model\n> as a stub domain does not offer protection against the host denial of\n> service issue. However it does offer some protection against secondary\n> issues such as denial of service against dom0.\n",

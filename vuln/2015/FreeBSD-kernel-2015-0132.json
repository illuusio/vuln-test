In the best case this leads\n> to wrong TLS extensions being used for the client, worst-case a\n> crash of the proxy terminating all active transactions.\n>\n> Incorrect message size checks and assumptions about the existence\n> of TLS extensions in the SSL/TLS handshake message can lead to very\n> high CPU consumption (up to and including 'infinite loop'\n> behaviour).\n>\n> The above can be triggered remotely. Though there is one layer of\n> authorization applied before this processing to check that the\n> client is allowed to use the proxy, that check is generally weak. MS\n> Skype on Windows XP is known to trigger some of these.\n\nThe FreeBSD port does not use SSL by default and is not vulnerable\nin the default configuration.",

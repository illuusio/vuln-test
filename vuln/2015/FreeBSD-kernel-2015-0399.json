A malicious client with string\n> lengths exceeding the request length can cause the server to copy\n> adjacent memory data into the XKB structs. This data is then\n> available to the client via the XkbGetGeometry request. The\n> data length is at least up to 64k, it is possible to obtain\n> more data by chaining strings, each string length is then\n> determined by whatever happens to be in that 16-bit region of\n> memory.\n>\n> A similarly crafted request can likely cause the X server\n> to crash.",

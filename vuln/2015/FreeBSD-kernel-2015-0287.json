But it will also\n> pass the spoof check, because a file named .html and containing\n> actual HTML passes the spoof check.\n>\n> This change makes it so that we also check the supplied content\n> type. So even if the file contains HTML and ends with .html, it\n> doesn't match the content type of `image/jpeg` and so it fails.",

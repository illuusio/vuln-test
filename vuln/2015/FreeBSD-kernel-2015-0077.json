For a PuTTY SSH session, this must be before\n> encryption, so the attacker likely needs access to the server you're\n> connecting to. For instance, an attacker on a multi-user machine\n> that you connect to could trick you into running cat on a file they\n> control containing a malicious escape sequence. (Unix write(1) is\n> not a vector for this, if implemented correctly.)\n>\n> Only PuTTY, PuTTYtel, and pterm are affected; other PuTTY tools do\n> not include the terminal emulator, so cannot be exploited this\n> way.",

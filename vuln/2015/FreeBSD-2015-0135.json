    "details": "cURL reports:\n\n> libcurl can wrongly send HTTP credentials when re-using connections.\n>\n> libcurl allows applications to set credentials for the upcoming\n> transfer with HTTP Basic authentication, like with CURLOPT_USERPWD for\n> example. Name and password. Just like all other libcurl options the\n> credentials are sticky and are kept associated with the \\\"handle\\\"\n> until something is made to change the situation.\n>\n> Further, libcurl offers a curl_easy_reset() function that resets a\n> handle back to its pristine state in terms of all settable options. A\n> reset is of course also supposed to clear the credentials. A reset is\n> typically used to clear up the handle and prepare it for a new,\n> possibly unrelated, transfer.\n>\n> Within such a handle, libcurl can also store a set of previous\n> connections in case a second transfer is requested to a host name for\n> which an existing connection is already kept alive.\n>\n> With this flaw present, using the handle even after a reset would make\n> libcurl accidentally use those credentials in a subsequent request if\n> done to the same host name and connection as was previously accessed.\n>\n> An example case would be first requesting a password protected\n> resource from one section of a web site, and then do a second request\n> of a public resource from a completely different part of the site\n> without authentication. This flaw would then inadvertently leak the\n> credentials in the second request.\n\n> libcurl can get tricked by a malicious SMB server to send off data it\n> did not intend to.\n>\n> In libcurl\\'s state machine function handling the SMB protocol\n> (smb_request_state()), two length and offset values are extracted from\n> data that has arrived over the network, and those values are\n> subsequently used to figure out what data range to send back.\n>\n> The values are used and trusted without boundary checks and are just\n> assumed to be valid. This allows carefully handcrafted packages to\n> trick libcurl into responding and sending off data that was not\n> intended. Or just crash if the values cause libcurl to access invalid\n> memory.\n",

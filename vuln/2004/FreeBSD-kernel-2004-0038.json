Arguments like\n\"body[p\", \"binary[p\" or \"binary[p\" will be wrongly detected\nand the bufferposition can point outside of the allocated\nbuffer for the rest of the parsing process. When the parser\ntriggers the PARSE\\_PARTIAL macro after such a malformed\nargument was received this can lead to a similiar one byte\nmemory corruption and allows remote code execution, when the\nheap layout was successfully controlled by the attacker.",

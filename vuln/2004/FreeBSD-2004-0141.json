Compromise of a KDC host\n> compromises the security of the entire authentication realm served by\n> the KDC. Additionally, double-free vulnerabilities exist in MIT\n> Kerberos 5 library code, making client programs and application\n> servers vulnerable.\n\nDouble-free vulnerabilities of this type are not believed to be\nexploitable for code execution on FreeBSD systems. However, the\npotential for other ill effects may exist.\n",

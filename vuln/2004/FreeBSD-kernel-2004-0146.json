Additionally, double-free\n> vulnerabilities exist in MIT Kerberos 5 library code, making\n> client programs and application servers vulnerable.\n\nDouble-free vulnerabilities of this type are not believed to be\nexploitable for code execution on FreeBSD systems. However,\nthe potential for other ill effects may exist.",

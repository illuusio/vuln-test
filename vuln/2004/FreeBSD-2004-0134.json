From their advisory:\n\n> The NSS library contains a flaw in SSLv2 record parsing that may lead\n> to remote compromise. When parsing the first record in an SSLv2\n> negotiation, the client hello message, the server fails to validate\n> the length of a record field. As a result, it is possible for an\n> attacker to trigger a heap-based overflow of arbitrary length.\n\nNote that the vulnerable NSS library is also present in Mozilla-based\nbrowsers. However, it is not believed that browsers are affected, as the\nvulnerability is present only in code used by SSLv2 \\*servers\\*.\n",

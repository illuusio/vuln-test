Smaller lengths will cause kadmind to read an arbitrary\namount of data into a minimally-sized buffer on the heap.\n\nA remote attacker may send a specially formatted message to kadmind,\ncausing it to crash or possibly resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe kadmind daemon is part of Kerberos 5 support. However, this bug will\nonly be present if kadmind was built with additional Kerberos 4 support.\nThus, only systems that have \\*both\\* Heimdal Kerberos 5 and Kerberos 4\ninstalled might be affected.\n\n*NOTE:* On FreeBSD 4 systems, \\`kadmind\\' may be installed as\n\\`k5admind\\'.\n",

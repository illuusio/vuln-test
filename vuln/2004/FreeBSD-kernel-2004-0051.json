A malicious attacker can send packets with\n> escape sequence payloads to exploit this vulnerability.\n>\n> If Hafiye has been started with -n packet count option ,\n> the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. For\n> remote code execution the victim must press Enter after\n> program exit.\n\nNote that it appears that this bug can only be exploited in\nconjunction with a terminal emulator that honors the\nappropriate escape sequences.",

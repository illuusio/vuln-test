Arguments like \\\"body\\[p\\\", \\\"binary\\[p\\\"\nor \\\"binary\\[p\\\" will be wrongly detected and the bufferposition can\npoint outside of the allocated buffer for the rest of the parsing\nprocess. When the parser triggers the PARSE_PARTIAL macro after such a\nmalformed argument was received this can lead to a similiar one byte\nmemory corruption and allows remote code execution, when the heap layout\nwas successfully controlled by the attacker.\n",

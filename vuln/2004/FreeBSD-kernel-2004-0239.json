From the e-matters\nadvisory:\n\n> While developing a custom add-on, an integer overflow\n> in the handling of AIM DirectIM packets was revealed that\n> could lead to a remote compromise of the IM client. After\n> disclosing this bug to the vendor, they had to make a\n> hurried release because of a change in the Yahoo connection\n> procedure that rendered GAIM useless. Unfourtunately at the\n> same time a closer look onto the sourcecode revealed 11 more\n> vulnerabilities.\n>\n> The 12 identified problems range from simple standard\n> stack overflows, over heap overflows to an integer overflow\n> that can be abused to cause a heap overflow. Due to the\n> nature of instant messaging many of these bugs require\n> man-in-the-middle attacks between client and server. But the\n> underlying protocols are easy to implement and MIM attacks\n> on ordinary TCP sessions is a fairly simple task.\n>\n> In combination with the latest kernel vulnerabilities or\n> the habit of users to work as root/administrator these bugs\n> can result in remote root compromises.",

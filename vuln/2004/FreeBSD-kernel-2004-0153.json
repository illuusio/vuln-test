From their advisory:\n\n> The NSS library contains a flaw in SSLv2 record parsing\n> that may lead to remote compromise. When parsing the\n> first record in an SSLv2 negotiation, the client hello\n> message, the server fails to validate the length of a\n> record field. As a result, it is possible for an attacker\n> to trigger a heap-based overflow of arbitrary length.\n\nNote that the vulnerable NSS library is also present in\nMozilla-based browsers. However, it is not believed that\nbrowsers are affected, as the vulnerability is present only in\ncode used by SSLv2 \\*servers\\*.",

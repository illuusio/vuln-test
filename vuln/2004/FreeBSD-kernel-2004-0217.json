The code assumed that the length\ngiven in the framing was always two or more bytes. Smaller\nlengths will cause kadmind to read an arbitrary amount of\ndata into a minimally-sized buffer on the heap.\n\nA remote attacker may send a specially formatted message\nto kadmind, causing it to crash or possibly resulting in\narbitrary code execution.\n\nThe kadmind daemon is part of Kerberos 5 support. However,\nthis bug will only be present if kadmind was built with\nadditional Kerberos 4 support. Thus, only systems that have\n\\*both\\* Heimdal Kerberos 5 and Kerberos 4 installed might\nbe affected.\n\n*NOTE:* On FreeBSD 4 systems, `kadmind' may be\ninstalled as `k5admind'.",

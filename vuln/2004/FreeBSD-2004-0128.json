A malicious website can use\n> this as part of a session fixation attack. See e.g.\n> http://www.acros.si/papers/session_fixation.pdf\n>\n> Affected are all country specific secondary top level domains that use\n> more than 2 characters in the secondary part of the domain name and\n> that use a secondary part other than com, net, mil, org, gov, edu or\n> int. Examples of affected domains are .ltd.uk, .plc.uk and .firm.in\n>\n> It should be noted that popular domains such as .co.uk, .co.in and\n> .com are NOT affected.\n",

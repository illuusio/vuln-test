Additionally, they have the power to delete\n> users entirely from the system if they have no other org membership.\n> This leads to two situations:\n>\n> 1. They can delete a server admin if the organization\n>    the Organization Admin manages is the server admin\u2019s final\n>    organizational membership.\n> 2. They can delete any user (regardless of whether they are a server\n>    admin or not) if that user currently belongs to no organizations.\n>\n> These two situations allow an organization manager to disrupt\n> instance-wide activity by continually deleting server administrators\n> if there is only one organization or if the server administrators are\n> not part of any organization.\n>\n> The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.5 Medium.",

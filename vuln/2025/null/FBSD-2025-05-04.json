The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9\n\tversion. A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o\n\tprovider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version.\n\tWe would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue\n\tto our attention.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

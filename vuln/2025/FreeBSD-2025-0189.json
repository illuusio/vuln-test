An\n> organization admin could remove any user from the specific\n> organization they manage. Additionally, they have the power to delete\n> users entirely from the system if they have no other org membership.\n> This leads to two situations:\n>\n> 1.  They can delete a server admin if the organization the\n>     Organization Admin manages is the server admin's final\n>     organizational membership.\n> 2.  They can delete any user (regardless of whether they are a server\n>     admin or not) if that user currently belongs to no organizations.\n>\n> These two situations allow an organization manager to disrupt\n> instance-wide activity by continually deleting server administrators\n> if there is only one organization or if the server administrators are\n> not part of any organization.\n>\n> The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.5 Medium.\n",

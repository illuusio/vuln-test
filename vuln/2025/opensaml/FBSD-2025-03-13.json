The Shibboleth\n\t    Service Provider is impacted by this issue, and it manifests as\n\t    a critical security issue in that context.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Parameter manipulation allows the forging of signed SAML messages\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    A number of vulnerabilities in the OpenSAML library used by the\n\t    Shibboleth Service Provider allowed for creative manipulation of\n\t    parameters combined with reuse of the contents of older requests\n\t    to fool the library's signature verification of non-XML based\n\t    signed messages.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Most uses of that feature involve very low or\n\t    low impact use cases without critical security implications;\n\t    however, there are two scenarios that are much more critical,\n\t    one affecting the SP and one affecting some implementers who\n\t    have implemented their own code on top of our OpenSAML library\n\t    and done so improperly.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    The SP's support for the HTTP-POST-SimpleSign SAML binding for\n\t    Single Sign-On responses is its critical vulnerability, and it\n\t    is enabled by default (regardless of what one's published SAML\n\t    metadata may advertise).\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    The other critical case involves a mistake that\n\t    does *not* impact the Shibboleth SP, allowing SSO to occur over\n\t    the HTTP-Redirect binding contrary to the plain language of the\n\t    SAML Browser SSO profile. The SP does not support this, but\n\t    other implementers may have done so.\n\t  </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t    Prior to updating, it is possible to mitigate the POST-SimpleSign\n\t    vulnerability by editing the protocols.xml configuration file and\n\t    removing this line:\n\t    <code>&lt;Binding id=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST-SimpleSign\"\n\t\tpath=\"/SAML2/POST-SimpleSign\" /&gt;</code>\n\t  </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

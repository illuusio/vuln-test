Promiscuous NS RRSets that complement\n> positive DNS replies in the authority section can be used to trick\n> resolvers to update their delegation information for the zone. Usually\n> these RRSets are used to update the resolver\\'s knowledge of the\n> zone\\'s name servers. A malicious actor can exploit the possible\n> poisonous effect by injecting NS RRSets (and possibly their respective\n> address records) in a reply. This could be done for example by trying\n> to spoof a packet or fragmentation attacks. Unbound would then proceed\n> to update the NS RRSet data it already has since the new data has\n> enough trust for it, i.e., in-zone data for the delegation point.\n> Unbound 1.24.1 includes a fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and\n> their respective address records) from replies mitigating the possible\n> poison effect.\n",

The operation \\\"Show origin of this line\\\" is\n> affected as well, regardless of the option being enabled or not.\n>\n> CVE-2025-27614: Gitk: A Git repository can be crafted in such a way\n> that a user who has cloned the repository can be tricked into running\n> any script supplied by the attacker by invoking \\`gitk filename\\`,\n> where \\`filename\\` has a particular structure.\n>\n> CVE-2025-46835: Git GUI: When a user clones an untrusted repository\n> and is tricked into editing a file located in a maliciously named\n> directory in the repository, then Git GUI can create and overwrite any\n> writable file.\n>\n> CVE-2025-48384: Git: When reading a config value, Git strips any\n> trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config\n> entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be\n> lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if\n> the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read\n> resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location.\n> If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule\n> hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable\n> post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after\n> checkout.\n>\n> CVE-2025-48385: Git: When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally\n> fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the\n> server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client\n> does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles,\n> which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This\n> protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to\n> a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully\n> controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to\n> arbitrary code execution.\n>\n> CVE-2025-48386: Git: The wincred credential helper uses a static\n> buffer (\\`target\\`) as a unique key for storing and comparing against\n> internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds\n> check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to\n> it with \\`wcsncat()\\`, leading to potential buffer overflows.\n",

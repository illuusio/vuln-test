Unbound is also vulnerable when compiled with ECS\n> support, i.e., \\'\\--enable-subnet\\', AND configured to send ECS\n> information along with queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at\n> least one of the \\'send-client-subnet\\', \\'client-subnet-zone\\' or\n> \\'client-subnet-always-forward\\' options is used. Resolvers supporting\n> ECS need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different\n> outgoing ECS information. This re-opens up resolvers to a birthday\n> paradox attack (Rebirthday Attack) that tries to match the DNS\n> transaction ID in order to cache non-ECS poisonous replies.\n",

Exiv2 is a\n\t  command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and\n\t  modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when\n\t  Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker\n\t  could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if\n\t  they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.</p>\n\t  <p>Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which\n\t  is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For\n\t  example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you\n\t  need to add an extra command-line argument such as fixiso.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

The option \"Support per-file encoding\" must have been\n> enabled. The operation \"Show origin of this line\" is affected as\n> well, regardless of the option being enabled or not.\n>\n> CVE-2025-27614: Gitk:\n> A Git repository can be crafted in such a way that a user who has\n> cloned the repository can be tricked into running any script\n> supplied by the attacker by invoking `gitk filename`, where\n> `filename` has a particular structure.\n>\n> CVE-2025-46835: Git GUI:\n> When a user clones an untrusted repository and is tricked into\n> editing a file located in a maliciously named directory in the\n> repository, then Git GUI can create and overwrite any writable\n> file.\n>\n> CVE-2025-48384: Git:\n> When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage\n> return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values\n> with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when\n> the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the\n> submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read\n> resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect\n> location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the\n> submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable\n> post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed\n> after checkout.\n>\n> CVE-2025-48385: Git:\n> When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle\n> advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to\n> offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not\n> perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which\n> allows the remote side to perform protocol injection.\n> This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched\n> bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched\n> content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst\n> case lead to arbitrary code execution.\n>\n> CVE-2025-48386: Git:\n> The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (`target`) as a\n> unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage. This\n> credential helper does not properly bounds check the available\n> space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with\n> `wcsncat()`, leading to potential buffer overflows.",

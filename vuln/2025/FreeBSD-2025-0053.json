Exiv2 is\n> a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,\n> and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is\n> triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image\n> file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain\n> code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a\n> crafted image file.\n>\n> Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which\n> is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata.\n> For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application,\n> you need to add an extra command-line argument such as fixiso.\n",

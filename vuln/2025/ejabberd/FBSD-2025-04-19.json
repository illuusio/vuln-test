Server was\n\t  replacing just first instance of occupant-id with its own\n\t  version, leaving other ones untouched. That would mean that\n\t  depending on order in which clients send occupant-id, they\n\t  could see value provided by sender, and that could be used\n\t  to spoof as different sender.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

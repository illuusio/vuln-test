This is achieved\n> via the loop device handler, which handles requests sent through the\n> D-BUS interface. As two of the parameters of this handle, it receives\n> the file descriptor list and index specifying the file where the loop\n> device should be backed. The function itself validates the index value\n> to ensure it isn\\'t bigger than the maximum value allowed. However, it\n> fails to validate the lower bound, allowing the index parameter to be\n> a negative value. Under these circumstances, an attacker can cause the\n> UDisks daemon to crash or perform a local privilege escalation by\n> gaining access to files owned by privileged users.\n",

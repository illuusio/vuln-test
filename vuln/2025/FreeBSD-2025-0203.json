By default, the Xserver assumes at least one\n>   cursor is provided while a client may actually pass no cursor at\n>   all, which causes an out-of-bound read creating the animated cursor\n>   and a crash of the Xserver.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-49177: Data leak in XFIXES Extension 6\n>   (XFixesSetClientDisconnectMode)\n>\n>   The handler of XFixesSetClientDisconnectMode does not check the\n>   client request length. A client could send a shorter request and\n>   read data from a former request.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-49178: Unprocessed client request via bytes to ignore\n>\n>   When reading requests from the clients, the input buffer might be\n>   shared and used between different clients. If a given client sends a\n>   full request with non-zero bytes to ignore, the bytes to ignore may\n>   still be non-zero even though the request is full, in which case the\n>   buffer could be shared with another client who\\'s request will not\n>   be processed because of those bytes to ignore, leading to a possible\n>   hang of the other client request.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-49179: Integer overflow in X Record extension\n>\n>   The RecordSanityCheckRegisterClients() function in the X Record\n>   extension implementation of the Xserver checks for the request\n>   length, but does not check for integer overflow. A client might send\n>   a very large value for either the number of clients or the number of\n>   protocol ranges that will cause an integer overflow in the request\n>   length computation, defeating the check for request length.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-49180: Integer overflow in RandR extension\n>   (RRChangeProviderProperty)\n>\n>   A client might send a request causing an integer overflow when\n>   computing the total size to allocate in RRChangeProviderProperty().\n",

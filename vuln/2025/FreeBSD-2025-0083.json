Prior to 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3, go-redis potentially\n> responds out of order when \\`CLIENT SETINFO\\` times out during\n> connection establishment. This can happen when the client is\n> configured to transmit its identity, there are network connectivity\n> issues, or the client was configured with aggressive timeouts. The\n> problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections, you\n> receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the\n> connection. All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses.\n> When used with the default ConnPool once a connection is returned\n> after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the\n> connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means\n> that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is\n> discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3. You can\n> prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true\n> when constructing the client instance.\n>\n> golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Prior to 5.2.2\n> and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to\n> strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a\n> result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header\n> consists of Bearer followed by many period characters, a call to that\n> function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands\n> for the length of the function\\'s argument), with a constant factor of\n> about 16.

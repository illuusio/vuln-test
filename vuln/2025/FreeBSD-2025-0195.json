An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\n> by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into\n> processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An\n> exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the\n> victim\\'s user decoding client and, possibly, perform arbitrary\n> commands on the victim\\'s host by abusing the heap overflow.\n",

The out-of-bounds\n> read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted\n> image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to\n> cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the\n> victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\n>\n> Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which\n> is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata.\n> For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application,\n> you need to add an extra command-line argument such as delete.\n",

An attacker could exploit\n> this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to be scanned\n> by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\n> the attacker to trigger a buffer overflow, likely resulting in the\n> termination of the ClamAV scanning process and a DoS condition on\n> the affected software. Although unproven, there is also a possibility\n> that an attacker could leverage the buffer overflow to execute\n> arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV process.",

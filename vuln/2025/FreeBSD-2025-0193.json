This vulnerability exists because memory\n> buffers are allocated incorrectly when PDF files are processed. An\n> attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF\n> file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful\n> exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a buffer overflow, likely\n> resulting in the termination of the ClamAV scanning process and a DoS\n> condition on the affected software. Although unproven, there is also a\n> possibility that an attacker could leverage the buffer overflow to\n> execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV process.\n",

    "details": "# Problem Description:\n\nConnected sockets are not intended to belong to load-balancing groups.\nHowever, the kernel failed to check the connection state of sockets when\nadding them to load-balancing groups. Furthermore, when looking up the\ndestination socket for an incoming packet, the kernel will match a\nsocket belonging to a load-balancing group even if it is connected.\n\nConnected sockets are only supposed to receive packets originating from\nthe connected host. The above behavior violates this contract.\n\n# Impact:\n\nSoftware which sets SO_REUSEPORT_LB on a socket and then connects it to\na host will not observe any problems. However, due to its membership in\na load-balancing group, that socket will receive packets originating\nfrom any host. This breaks the contract of the connect(2) and implied\nconnect via sendto(2), and may leave the application vulnerable to\nspoofing attacks.\n",

If\n>   later, the same function is called with a non-zero value of groups,\n>   this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the\n>   wrong size.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-26598: Out-of-bounds write in CreatePointerBarrierClient()\n>\n>   The function GetBarrierDevice() searches for the pointer device\n>   based on its device id and returns the matching value, or supposedly\n>   NULL if no match was found. However the code will return the last\n>   element of the list if no matching device id was found which can\n>   lead to out of bounds memory access.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-26599: Use of uninitialized pointer in compRedirectWindow()\n>\n>   The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the\n>   backing pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a\n>   BadAlloc error without the validation of the window tree marked just\n>   before, which leaves the validate data partly initialized, and the\n>   use of an uninitialized pointer later.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-26600: Use-after-free in PlayReleasedEvents()\n>\n>   When a device is removed while still frozen, the events queued for\n>   that device remain while the device itself is freed and replaying\n>   the events will cause a use after free.\n>\n> - CVE-2025-26601: Use-after-free in SyncInitTrigger()\n>\n>   When changing an alarm, the values of the change mask are evaluated\n>   one after the other, changing the trigger values as requested and\n>   eventually, SyncInitTrigger() is called. If one of the changes\n>   triggers an error, the function will return early, not adding the\n>   new sync object. This can be used to cause a use after free when the\n>   alarm eventually triggers.\n",

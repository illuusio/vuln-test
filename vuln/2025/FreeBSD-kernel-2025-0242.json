This applies to files that would normally have\nrestricted visibility, such as /etc/master.passwd.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nAn unprivileged local user may be able to read encrypted root\nand user passwords from the temporary master.passwd file created\nin /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts. This is possible only when conflicts\nwithin the password file arise during an update, and the unprotected\nfile is deleted when conflicts are resolved.",

However, the output path assumes that the\ndestination address for the response is on a directly connected network.\n\n# Impact:\n\nUpon receipt of a query from a source which is not on a directly\nconnected network, routed(8) will trigger an assertion and terminate.\nThe affected system\\'s routing table will no longer be updated. If the\naffected system is a router, its routes will eventually expire from\nother routers\\' routing tables, and its networks will no longer be\nreachable unless they are also connected to another router.\n",

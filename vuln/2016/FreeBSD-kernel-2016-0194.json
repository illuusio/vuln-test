For each SCTP session, there are two\nseparate instances in which a 4-byte fragment may be transmitted.\n\nThis memory might contain sensitive information, such as portions of the\nfile cache or terminal buffers. This information might be directly\nuseful, or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in\nsome way. For example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered\npassword.",

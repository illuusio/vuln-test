If you ever used any of the publish\n> functionality (publish to Facebook, publish to Flickr, etc.), your\n> passwords may have been stolen; changing them is not a bad idea.\n>\n> What is the risk of the update? Regressions. The easiest way to\n> validate TLS certificates was to upgrade WebKit; it seems to work but\n> I don\\'t have accounts with the online services it supports, so I\n> don\\'t know if photo publishing still works properly on all the\n> services.\n",

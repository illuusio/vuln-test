    "details": "Node.js v6.9.0 LTS contains the following security fixes, specific to v6.x:\n\n> Disable auto-loading of openssl.cnf: Don't automatically attempt to load an OpenSSL\n> configuration file, from the OPENSSL\\_CONF environment variable or from the default\n> location for the current platform. Always triggering a configuration file load attempt\n> may allow an attacker to load compromised OpenSSL configuration into a Node.js process\n> if they are able to place a file in a default location.\n>\n> Patched V8 arbitrary memory read (CVE-2016-5172): The V8 parser mishandled scopes,\n> potentially allowing an attacker to obtain sensitive information from arbitrary memory\n> locations via crafted JavaScript code. This vulnerability would require an attacker to\n> be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a Node.js process.\n>\n> Create a unique v8\\_inspector WebSocket address: Generate a UUID for each execution of\n> the inspector. This provides additional security to prevent unauthorized clients from\n> connecting to the Node.js process via the v8\\_inspector port when running with --inspect.\n> Since the debugging protocol allows extensive access to the internals of a running process,\n> and the execution of arbitrary code, it is important to limit connections to authorized\n> tools only. Note that the v8\\_inspector protocol in Node.js is still considered an\n> experimental feature. Vulnerability originally reported by Jann Horn.\n>\n> All of these vulnerabilities are considered low-severity for Node.js users, however,\n> users of Node.js v6.x should upgrade at their earliest convenience.",

The\n> BeanShell team would like to thank them for their help and\n> contributions to this fix!\n>\n> An application that includes BeanShell on the classpath may be\n> vulnerable if another part of the application uses Java serialization\n> or XStream to deserialize data from an untrusted source.\n>\n> A vulnerable application could be exploited for remote code execution,\n> including executing arbitrary shell commands.\n>\n> This update fixes the vulnerability in BeanShell, but it is worth\n> noting that applications doing such deserialization might still be\n> insecure through other libraries. It is recommended that application\n> developers take further measures such as using a restricted class\n> loader when deserializing. See notes on Java serialization security\n> XStream security and How to secure deserialization from untrusted\n> input without using encryption or sealing.\n",

Having a weak or virtually non-existent\n> random there makes these operations vulnerable.\n>\n> This function is brand new in 7.52.0 and is the result of an\n> overhaul to make sure libcurl uses strong random as much as\n> possible - provided by the backend TLS crypto libraries when\n> present. The faulty function was introduced in this commit.\n>\n> We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.",

Previously some invalid commands would\n> be loaded without error. Note that Privoxy's pcrs sources (action\n> and filter files) are considered trustworthy input and should not be\n> writable by untrusted third-parties. CVE-2015-1381.\n>\n> Fixed an 'invalid read' bug which could at least theoretically\n> cause Privoxy to crash. So far, no crashes have been observed.\n> CVE-2015-1382.",

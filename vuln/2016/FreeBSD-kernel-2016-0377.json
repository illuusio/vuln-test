This is the case even if the VM entry\n> information specifies an exception to be injected immediately (in\n> which case the bad instruction pointer would possibly never get used\n> for other than pushing onto the exception handler's stack).\n> Provided the guest OS allows user mode to map the virtual memory\n> space immediately below the canonical/non-canonical address\n> boundary, a non-canonical instruction pointer can result even from\n> normal user mode execution. VM entry failure, however, is fatal to\n> the guest.\n>\n> Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the\n> guest.",

    "details": "# Problem Description:\n\nThere is a mistake with the introduction of VNET, which converted the\nglobal limit on the number of segments that could belong to reassembly\nqueues into a per-VNET limit. Because mbufs are allocated from a global\npool, in the presence of a sufficient number of VNETs, the total number\nof mbufs attached to reassembly queues can grow to the total number of\nmbufs in the system, at which point all network traffic would cease.\n\n# Impact:\n\nAn attacker who can establish concurrent TCP connections across a\nsufficient number of VNETs and manipulate the inbound packet streams\nsuch that the maximum number of mbufs are enqueued on each reassembly\nqueue can cause mbuf cluster exhaustion on the target system, resulting\nin a Denial of Service condition.\n\nAs the default per-VNET limit on the number of segments that can belong\nto reassembly queues is 1/16 of the total number of mbuf clusters in the\nsystem, only systems that have 16 or more VNET instances are vulnerable.\n",

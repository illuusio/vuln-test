These vulnerabilities manifest in various Memcached functions\n> that are used in inserting, appending, prepending, or modifying\n> key-value data pairs. Systems which also have Memcached compiled with\n> support for SASL authentication are also vulnerable to a third flaw\n> due to how Memcached handles SASL authentication commands.\n>\n> An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a\n> specifically crafted Memcached command to the targeted server.\n> Additionally, these vulnerabilities could also be exploited to leak\n> sensitive process information which an attacker could use to bypass\n> common exploitation mitigations, such as ASLR, and can be triggered\n> multiple times. This enables reliable exploitation which makes these\n> vulnerabilities severe.\n",

These vulnerabilities manifest in various Memcached\n> functions that are used in inserting, appending, prepending, or\n> modifying key-value data pairs. Systems which also have Memcached\n> compiled with support for SASL authentication are also vulnerable to\n> a third flaw due to how Memcached handles SASL authentication\n> commands.\n>\n> An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a\n> specifically crafted Memcached command to the targeted server.\n> Additionally, these vulnerabilities could also be exploited to leak\n> sensitive process information which an attacker could use to bypass\n> common exploitation mitigations, such as ASLR, and can be triggered\n> multiple times. This enables reliable exploitation which makes these\n> vulnerabilities severe.",

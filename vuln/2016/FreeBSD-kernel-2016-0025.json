So, the operand size is always 8 or 16. When support\n> for CMPXCHG16B emulation was added to the instruction emulator,\n> this restriction on the set of possible operand sizes was relied on\n> in some parts of the emulation; but a wrong, fully general, operand\n> size value was used for other parts of the emulation. As a result,\n> if a guest uses a supposedly-ignored operand size prefix, a small\n> amount of hypervisor stack data is leaked to the guests: a 96 bit\n> leak to guests running in 64-bit mode; or, a 32 bit leak to other\n> guests.\n>\n> A malicious unprivileged guest may be able to obtain sensitive\n> information from the host.",

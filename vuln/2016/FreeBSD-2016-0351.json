If this can be done often enough, it will\nprevent that association from working. \\[CVE-2016-4955, Reported by\nMiroslav Lichvar of Red Hat\\]\n\nThe fix for NtpBug2978 does not cover broadcast associations, so\nbroadcast clients can be triggered to flip into interleave mode.\n\\[CVE-2016-4956, Reported by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.\\]\n\n# Impact:\n\nMalicious remote attackers may be able to break time synchronization, or\ncause the ntpd(8) daemon to crash.\n",

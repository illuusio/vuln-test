    "details": "The Xen Project reports:\n\n> The Xen x86 emulator erroneously failed to consider the unusability of\n> segments when performing memory accesses.\n>\n> The intended behaviour is as follows: The user data segment (%ds, %es,\n> %fs and %gs) selectors may be NULL in 32-bit to prevent access. In\n> 64-bit, NULL has a special meaning for user segments, and there is no\n> way of preventing access. However, in both 32-bit and 64-bit, a NULL\n> LDT system segment is intended to prevent access.\n>\n> On Intel hardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the base as well as\n> most attributes, but sets the limit field to its largest possible\n> value. On AMD hardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the attributes,\n> leaving the stale base and limit intact.\n>\n> Xen may erroneously permit the access using unexpected base/limit\n> values.\n>\n> Ability to exploit this vulnerability on Intel is easy, but on AMD\n> depends in a complicated way on how the guest kernel manages LDTs.\n>\n> An unprivileged guest user program may be able to elevate its\n> privilege to that of the guest operating system.\n",

We recommend that all users\n> upgrade to Go 1.5.3, which fixes the issue. Go programs must be\n> recompiled with Go 1.5.3 in order to receive the fix.\n>\n> The Go team would like to thank Nick Craig-Wood for identifying the\n> issue.\n>\n> This issue can affect RSA computations in crypto/rsa, which is used by\n> crypto/tls. TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak their\n> RSA private key due to this issue. Other protocol implementations that\n> create many RSA signatures could also be impacted in the same way.\n>\n> Specifically, incorrect results in one part of the RSA Chinese\n> Remainder computation can cause the result to be incorrect in such a\n> way that it leaks one of the primes. While RSA blinding should prevent\n> an attacker from crafting specific inputs that trigger the bug, on\n> 32-bit systems the bug can be expected to occur at random around one\n> in 2\\^26 times. Thus collecting around 64 million signatures (of known\n> data) from an affected server should be enough to extract the private\n> key used.\n>\n> On 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than one\n> in 2\\^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit. Nonetheless,\n> everyone is strongly encouraged to upgrade.\n",

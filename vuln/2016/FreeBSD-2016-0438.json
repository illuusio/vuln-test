Contributed and custom modules may use this\n> mechanism to restrict access to certain entities by implementing\n> hook_query_alter() or hook_query_TAG_alter() in order to add\n> additional conditions. Queries can be distinguished by means of query\n> tags. As the documentation on EntityFieldQuery::addTag() suggests,\n> access-tags on entity queries normally follow the form\n> ENTITY_TYPE_access (e.g. node_access). However, the taxonomy module\\'s\n> access query tag predated this system and used term_access as the\n> query tag instead of taxonomy_term_access.\n>\n> As a result, before this security release modules wishing to restrict\n> access to taxonomy terms may have implemented an unsupported tag, or\n> needed to look for both tags (term_access and taxonomy_term_access) in\n> order to be compatible with queries generated both by Drupal core as\n> well as those generated by contributed modules like Entity Reference.\n> Otherwise information on taxonomy terms might have been disclosed to\n> unprivileged users.\n>\n> ### Incorrect cache context on password reset page (Less critical - Drupal 8)\n>\n> The user password reset form does not specify a proper cache context,\n> which can lead to cache poisoning and unwanted content on the page.\n>\n> ### Confirmation forms allow external URLs to be injected (Moderately critical - Drupal 7)\n>\n> Under certain circumstances, malicious users could construct a URL to\n> a confirmation form that would trick users into being redirected to a\n> 3rd party website after interacting with the form, thereby exposing\n> the users to potential social engineering attacks.\n>\n> ### Denial of service via transliterate mechanism (Moderately critical - Drupal 8)\n>\n> A specially crafted URL can cause a denial of service via the\n> transliterate mechanism.\n",

As such it is possible for the guest\n> to overwrite hypervisor memory.\n>\n> It is currently believed that the only way to trigger this bug is\n> to use the way that Xen currently incorrectly wraps CS:IP in 16 bit\n> modes. The included patch prevents such wrapping.\n>\n> A malicious HVM guest administrator can escalate their privilege to\n> that of the host.",

    "details": "Node.js v6.9.0 LTS contains the following security fixes, specific to\nv6.x:\n\n> Disable auto-loading of openssl.cnf: Don\\'t automatically attempt to\n> load an OpenSSL configuration file, from the OPENSSL_CONF environment\n> variable or from the default location for the current platform. Always\n> triggering a configuration file load attempt may allow an attacker to\n> load compromised OpenSSL configuration into a Node.js process if they\n> are able to place a file in a default location.\n>\n> Patched V8 arbitrary memory read (CVE-2016-5172): The V8 parser\n> mishandled scopes, potentially allowing an attacker to obtain\n> sensitive information from arbitrary memory locations via crafted\n> JavaScript code. This vulnerability would require an attacker to be\n> able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a Node.js process.\n>\n> Create a unique v8_inspector WebSocket address: Generate a UUID for\n> each execution of the inspector. This provides additional security to\n> prevent unauthorized clients from connecting to the Node.js process\n> via the v8_inspector port when running with \\--inspect. Since the\n> debugging protocol allows extensive access to the internals of a\n> running process, and the execution of arbitrary code, it is important\n> to limit connections to authorized tools only. Note that the\n> v8_inspector protocol in Node.js is still considered an experimental\n> feature. Vulnerability originally reported by Jann Horn.\n>\n> All of these vulnerabilities are considered low-severity for Node.js\n> users, however, users of Node.js v6.x should upgrade at their earliest\n> convenience.\n",

Since\nthe bhyve process is running as root, this may allow guests to obtain\nfull control of the hosts they are running on.\n\n# Impact:\n\nFor bhyve virtual machines with the \\\"fbuf\\\" framebuffer device\nconfigured, if exploited, a malicious guest could obtain full access to\nnot just the host system, but to other virtual machines running on the\nsystem.\n",

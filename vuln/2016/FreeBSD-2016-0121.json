This is the case even if the VM entry\n> information specifies an exception to be injected immediately (in\n> which case the bad instruction pointer would possibly never get used\n> for other than pushing onto the exception handler\\'s stack). Provided\n> the guest OS allows user mode to map the virtual memory space\n> immediately below the canonical/non-canonical address boundary, a\n> non-canonical instruction pointer can result even from normal user\n> mode execution. VM entry failure, however, is fatal to the guest.\n>\n> Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the guest.\n",

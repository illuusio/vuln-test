This could occur if a composite modulus is provided, as this\n> algorithm is only defined for primes. This function is exposed to\n> attacker controlled input via the OS2ECP function during ECC point\n> decompression.\n>\n> Heap overflow on invalid ECC point - The PointGFp constructor did not\n> check that the affine coordinate arguments were less than the prime,\n> but then in curve multiplication assumed that both arguments if\n> multiplied would fit into an integer twice the size of the prime.\n>\n> The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of the\n> output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm in\n> cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled\n> multiplication function.\n>\n> The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding, which\n> accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for remote code\n> execution.\n>\n> On systems which use the mlock pool allocator, it would allow an\n> attacker to overwrite memory held in secure_vector objects. After this\n> point the write will hit the guard page at the end of the mmapped\n> region so it probably could not be used for code execution directly,\n> but would allow overwriting adjacent key material.\n",

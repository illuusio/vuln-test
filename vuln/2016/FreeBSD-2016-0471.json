    "details": "The Asterisk project reports:\n\n> The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace\n> when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a\n> colon character. Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only\n> spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII\n> character as if it were whitespace.\n>\n> This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem\n> with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination\n> of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE\n> request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the\n> request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described\n> above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog request to\n> Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The\n> result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources\n> without any authentication.\n>\n> If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not\n> affect you.\n>\n> If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of\n> what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect\n> you.\n>\n> If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not\n> affect you.\n",

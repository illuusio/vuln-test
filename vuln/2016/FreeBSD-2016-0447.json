This is unsafe in combination with recursive\n> pagetables.\n>\n> As there is no way to construct an L3 recursive pagetable in native\n> 32-bit PAE mode, disallow this option in 32-bit PV guests.\n>\n> A malicious 32-bit PV guest administrator can escalate their privilege\n> to that of the host.\n",

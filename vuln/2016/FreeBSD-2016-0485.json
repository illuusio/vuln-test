Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.\n\nCVE-2016-7427: Broadcast Mode Replay Prevention DoS. Reported by Matthew\nVan Gundy of Cisco ASIG.\n\nCVE-2016-7428: Broadcast Mode Poll Interval Enforcement DoS. Reported by\nMatthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.\n\nCVE-2016-7431: Regression: 010-origin: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass.\nReported by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra of Boston University.\n\nCVE-2016-7434: Null pointer dereference in\n\\_IO_str_init_static_internal(). Reported by Magnus Stubman.\n\nCVE-2016-7426: Client rate limiting and server responses. Reported by\nMiroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.\n\nCVE-2016-7433: Reboot sync calculation problem. Reported independently\nby Brian Utterback of Oracle, and by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal\nMalhotra of Boston University.\n\n# Impact:\n\nA remote attacker who can send a specially crafted packet to cause a\nNULL pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a Denial of\nService. \\[CVE-2016-9311\\]\n\nAn exploitable configuration modification vulnerability exists in the\ncontrol mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd. If, against long-standing\nBCP recommendations, \\\"restrict default noquery \\...\\\" is not specified,\na specially crafted control mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing\ninformation disclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps,\ndisabling legitimate monitoring by an attacker from remote.\n\\[CVE-2016-9310\\]\n\nAn attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically\ninject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast\ndomain which, while being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject\nbroadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers.\n\\[CVE-2016-7427\\]\n\nAn attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially\ncrafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while\nbeing logged by ntpd, will cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets\nfrom legitimate NTP broadcast servers. \\[CVE-2016-7428\\]\n\nOrigin timestamp problems were fixed in ntp 4.2.8p6. However, subsequent\ntimestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of\nsome Zero origin timestamp checks. \\[CVE-2016-7431\\]\n\nIf ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server that\nsends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of that\ncrafted malicious mrulist query packet. \\[CVE-2016-7434\\]\n\nAn attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server\nresponse) and knows the system is (mis)configured in this way can\nperiodically send packets with spoofed source address to keep the rate\nlimiting activated and prevent ntpd from accepting valid responses from\nits sources. \\[CVE-2016-7426\\]\n\nNtp Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included\ntwice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to a\nmisinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix for\nthis problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did not\ninclude the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulas have been\nreviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly.\n\\[CVE-2016-7433\\]\n",

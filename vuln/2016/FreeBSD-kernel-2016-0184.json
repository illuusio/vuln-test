    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\nThe OpenPAM library searches for policy definitions in\nseveral locations. While doing so, the absence of a policy\nfile is a soft failure (handled by searching in the next\nlocation) while the presence of an invalid file is a hard\nfailure (handled by returning an error to the caller).\n\nThe policy parser returns the same error code (ENOENT)\nwhen a syntactically valid policy references a non-existent\nmodule as when the requested policy file does not exist.\nThe search loop regards this as a soft failure and looks\nfor the next similarly-named policy, without discarding the\npartially-loaded configuration.\n\nA similar issue can arise if a policy contains an include\ndirective that refers to a non-existent policy.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nIf a module is removed, or the name of a module is\nmisspelled in the policy file, the PAM library will proceed\nwith a partially loaded configuration. Depending on the\nexact circumstances, this may result in a fail-open scenario\nwhere users are allowed to log in without a password, or\nwith an incorrect password.\n\nIn particular, if a policy references a module installed\nby a package or port, and that package or port is being\nreinstalled or upgraded, there is a brief window of time\nduring which the module is absent and policies that use it\nmay fail open. This can be especially damaging to Internet-facing\nSSH servers, which are regularly subjected to brute-force\nscans.",

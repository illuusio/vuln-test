This was fixed by PHP in September of 2015 with the releases\n> of PHP 5.4.45, 5.5.29, 5.6.13 (Note that this is fixed in all\n> versions of PHP 7 and has been back-ported in some specific Linux\n> LTS versions of PHP 5.3). This fixes the bug across all supported\n> PHP versions.\n\n> [20151207] - Core - SQL Injection\n> ---------------------------------\n>\n> Inadequate filtering of request data leads to a SQL Injection\n> vulnerability.",

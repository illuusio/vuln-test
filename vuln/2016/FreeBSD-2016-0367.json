If this functionality is used with a device that\n> has performed username/password authentication RTP resources are\n> leaked. This occurs because the code fails to release the old RTP\n> resources before allocating new ones in this scenario. If all\n> resources are used then RTP port exhaustion will occur and no RTP\n> sessions are able to be set up.\n>\n> If overlap dialing support is not needed the \\\"allowoverlap\\\" option\n> can be set to no. This will stop any usage of the scenario which\n> causes the resource exhaustion.\n",

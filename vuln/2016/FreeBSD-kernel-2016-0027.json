    "details": "The Asterisk project reports:\n\n> The chan\\_sip channel driver has a liberal definition\n> for whitespace when attempting to strip the content between\n> a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than\n> following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal\n> tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character\n> as if it were whitespace.\n>\n> This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is\n> placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In\n> such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid\n> To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request\n> into Asterisk without authentication since it believes\n> the request is an in-dialog request. However, because of\n> the bug described above, the request will look like an\n> out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then\n> process the request as a new call. The result is that\n> Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without\n> any authentication.\n>\n> If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then\n> this issue does not affect you.\n>\n> If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy\n> keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid), then\n> this issue does not affect you.\n>\n> If you use chan\\_pjsip instead of chan\\_sip, then this\n> issue does not affect you.",

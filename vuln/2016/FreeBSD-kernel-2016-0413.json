If you ever used any of\n> the publish functionality (publish to Facebook, publish to\n> Flickr, etc.), your passwords may have been stolen; changing\n> them is not a bad idea.\n>\n> What is the risk of the update? Regressions. The easiest\n> way to validate TLS certificates was to upgrade WebKit; it\n> seems to work but I don't have accounts with the online\n> services it supports, so I don't know if photo publishing\n> still works properly on all the services.",

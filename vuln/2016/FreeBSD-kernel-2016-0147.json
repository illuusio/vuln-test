[CVE-2016-4957, Reported by\nNicolas Edet of Cisco]\n\nAn attacker who knows the origin timestamp and can send\na spoofed packet containing a CRYPTO-NAK to an ephemeral\npeer target before any other response is sent can demobilize\nthat association. [CVE-2016-4953, Reported by Miroslav\nLichvar of Red Hat]\n\nAn attacker who is able to spoof packets with correct\norigin timestamps from enough servers before the expected\nresponse packets arrive at the target machine can affect\nsome peer variables and, for example, cause a false leap\nindication to be set. [CVE-2016-4954, Reported by Jakub\nProkes of Red Hat]\n\nAn attacker who is able to spoof a packet with a correct\norigin timestamp before the expected response packet arrives\nat the target machine can send a CRYPTO\\_NAK or a bad MAC\nand cause the association's peer variables to be cleared.\nIf this can be done often enough, it will prevent that\nassociation from working. [CVE-2016-4955, Reported by\nMiroslav Lichvar of Red Hat]\n\nThe fix for NtpBug2978 does not cover broadcast associations,\nso broadcast clients can be triggered to flip into interleave\nmode. [CVE-2016-4956, Reported by Miroslav Lichvar of Red\nHat.]\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nMalicious remote attackers may be able to break time\nsynchronization, or cause the ntpd(8) daemon to crash.",

This was\n> fixed by PHP in September of 2015 with the releases of PHP 5.4.45,\n> 5.5.29, 5.6.13 (Note that this is fixed in all versions of PHP 7 and\n> has been back-ported in some specific Linux LTS versions of PHP 5.3).\n> This fixes the bug across all supported PHP versions.\n\n> ## \\[20151207\\] - Core - SQL Injection\n>\n> Inadequate filtering of request data leads to a SQL Injection\n> vulnerability.\n",

However, the output path\nassumes that the destination address for the response is\non a directly connected network.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nUpon receipt of a query from a source which is not on a\ndirectly connected network, routed(8) will trigger an\nassertion and terminate. The affected system's routing table\nwill no longer be updated. If the affected system is a\nrouter, its routes will eventually expire from other routers'\nrouting tables, and its networks will no longer be reachable\nunless they are also connected to another router.",

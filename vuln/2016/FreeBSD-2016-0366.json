The resulting NULL pointer results in a crash when\n> attempting to determine if ACLs should be applied.\n>\n> This issue was introduced in the Asterisk 13.10 release and only\n> affects that release.\n>\n> This issue only affects users using the PJSIP stack with Asterisk.\n> Those users that use chan_sip are unaffected.\n",

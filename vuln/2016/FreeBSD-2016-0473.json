So, the operand size is always 8 or 16. When support for\n> CMPXCHG16B emulation was added to the instruction emulator, this\n> restriction on the set of possible operand sizes was relied on in some\n> parts of the emulation; but a wrong, fully general, operand size value\n> was used for other parts of the emulation. As a result, if a guest\n> uses a supposedly-ignored operand size prefix, a small amount of\n> hypervisor stack data is leaked to the guests: a 96 bit leak to guests\n> running in 64-bit mode; or, a 32 bit leak to other guests.\n>\n> A malicious unprivileged guest may be able to obtain sensitive\n> information from the host.\n",

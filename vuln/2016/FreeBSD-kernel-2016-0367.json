The resulting secret is 128 bits long, instead of the\n> recommended sizes of 1024 and 2048 bits respectively. There are\n> practical algorithms (Baby steps/Giant steps, Pollard\u2019s rho) that can\n> solve this problem in O(2^63) operations.\n>\n> Both client and server are are vulnerable, pre-authentication.\n> This vulnerability could be exploited by an eavesdropper with enough\n> resources to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions.

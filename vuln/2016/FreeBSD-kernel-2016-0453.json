We recommend that all\n> users upgrade to Go 1.5.3, which fixes the issue. Go programs must\n> be recompiled with Go 1.5.3 in order to receive the fix.\n>\n> The Go team would like to thank Nick Craig-Wood for identifying the\n> issue.\n>\n> This issue can affect RSA computations in crypto/rsa, which is used\n> by crypto/tls. TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak\n> their RSA private key due to this issue. Other protocol\n> implementations that create many RSA signatures could also be\n> impacted in the same way.\n>\n> Specifically, incorrect results in one part of the RSA Chinese\n> Remainder computation can cause the result to be incorrect in such a\n> way that it leaks one of the primes. While RSA blinding should\n> prevent an attacker from crafting specific inputs that trigger the\n> bug, on 32-bit systems the bug can be expected to occur at random\n> around one in 2^26 times. Thus collecting around 64 million\n> signatures (of known data) from an affected server should be enough\n> to extract the private key used.\n>\n> On 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than\n> one in 2^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit.\n> Nonetheless, everyone is strongly encouraged to upgrade.",

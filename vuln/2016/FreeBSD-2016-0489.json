Having a weak or virtually non-existent random there makes these\n> operations vulnerable.\n>\n> This function is brand new in 7.52.0 and is the result of an overhaul\n> to make sure libcurl uses strong random as much as possible - provided\n> by the backend TLS crypto libraries when present. The faulty function\n> was introduced in this commit.\n>\n> We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.\n",

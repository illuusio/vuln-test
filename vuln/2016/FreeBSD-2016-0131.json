There are practical\n> algorithms (Baby steps/Giant steps, Pollard's rho) that can solve this\n> problem in O(2\\^63) operations.\n>\n> Both client and server are are vulnerable, pre-authentication. This\n> vulnerability could be exploited by an eavesdropper with enough\n> resources to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions. The bug was found\n> during an internal code review by Aris Adamantiadis of the libssh\n> team.\n",

However, in both 32-bit and 64-bit,\n> a NULL LDT system segment is intended to prevent access.\n>\n> On Intel hardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the base as well\n> as most attributes, but sets the limit field to its largest possible\n> value. On AMD hardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the attributes,\n> leaving the stale base and limit intact.\n>\n> Xen may erroneously permit the access using unexpected base/limit\n> values.\n>\n> Ability to exploit this vulnerability on Intel is easy, but on AMD\n> depends in a complicated way on how the guest kernel manages LDTs.\n>\n> An unprivileged guest user program may be able to elevate its\n> privilege to that of the guest operating system.",

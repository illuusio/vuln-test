Such precaution was missing from the\n> hypervisor code inspecting the state of I/O requests sent to the\n> device model for assistance.\n>\n> Due to the offending field being a bitfield, it is however believed\n> that there is no issue in practice, since compilers, at least when\n> optimizing (which is always the case for non-debug builds), should find\n> it more expensive to extract the bit field value twice than to keep the\n> calculated value in a register.\n>\n> This vulnerability is exposed to malicious device models. In\n> conventional Xen systems this means the qemu which service an HVM\n> domain. On such systems this vulnerability can only be exploited if\n> the attacker has gained control of the device model qemu via another\n> vulnerability.\n>\n> Privilege escalation, host crash (Denial of Service), and leaked\n> information all cannot be excluded.",

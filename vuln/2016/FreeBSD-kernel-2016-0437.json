    "details": "OpenSSL project reports:\n\n> 1. Historically OpenSSL only ever generated DH parameters based on \"safe\"\n>    primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for\n>    generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114\n>    support. The primes used in such files may not be \"safe\". Where an\n>    application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are\n>    not \"safe\" then an attacker could use this fact to find a peer's private\n>    DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple\n>    handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example\n>    this could be used to discover a TLS server's private DH exponent if it's\n>    reusing the private DH exponent or it's using a static DH ciphersuite.\n>    OpenSSL provides the option SSL\\_OP\\_SINGLE\\_DH\\_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in\n>    TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server\n>    reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and\n>    would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular\n>    applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk.\n>    (CVE-2016-0701)\n> 2. A malicious client can negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on\n>    the server and complete SSLv2 handshakes even if all SSLv2 ciphers have\n>    been disabled, provided that the SSLv2 protocol was not also disabled via\n>    SSL\\_OP\\_NO\\_SSLv2.\n>    (CVE-2015-3197)",

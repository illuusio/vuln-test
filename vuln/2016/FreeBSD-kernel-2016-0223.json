Because volumes can have more than\n> one partition map, their objects are kept in an object vector. To\n> start looking for an item, this method tries to reference the proper\n> object using the partition map\u2019s object vector and the \"PartitionRef\"\n> field from the Long Allocation Descriptor. Lack of checking whether\n> the \"PartitionRef\" field is bigger than the available amount of\n> partition map objects causes a read out-of-bounds and can lead, in\n> some circumstances, to arbitrary code execution.",

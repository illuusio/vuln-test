Web content that tried to use those interfaces would\n>   not be able to use them with elevated privileges, but their presence\n>   would indicate certain browser features had been used, such as when\n>   a user opened the Dev Tools console.\n> - CVE-2024-8383: Firefox normally asks for confirmation before asking\n>   the operating system to find an application to handle a scheme that\n>   the browser does not support. It did not ask before doing so for the\n>   Usenet-related schemes news: and snews:. Since most operating\n>   systems don\\'t have a trusted newsreader installed by default, an\n>   unscrupulous program that the user downloaded could register itself\n>   as a handler. The website that served the application download could\n>   then launch that application at will.\n> - CVE-2024-8384: The JavaScript garbage collector could mis-color\n>   cross-compartment objects if OOM conditions were detected at the\n>   right point between two passes. This could have led to memory\n>   corruption.\n> - CVE-2024-8385: A difference in the handling of StructFields and\n>   ArrayTypes in WASM could be used to trigger an exploitable type\n>   confusion vulnerability.\n> - CVE-2024-8386: If a site had been granted the permission to open\n>   popup windows, it could cause Select elements to appear on top of\n>   another site to perform a spoofing attack.\n> - CVE-2024-8387: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 129, Firefox\n>   ESR 128.1, and Thunderbird 128.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence\n>   of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of\n>   these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n> - CVE-2024-8389: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 129.

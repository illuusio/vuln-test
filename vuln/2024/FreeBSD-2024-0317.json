This flaw, triggered by an invalid or\n>   unsupported extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors\n>   that disrupted the signature validation process. As a result, the\n>   enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have\n>   been bypassed. Signature validation in this context is used to\n>   ensure that third-party applications on the user\\'s computer have\n>   not tampered with the user\\'s extensions, limiting the impact of\n>   this issue.\n> - CVE-2024-11697: When handling keypress events, an attacker may have\n>   been able to trick a user into bypassing the \\\" Open Executable\n>   File?\\\" confirmation dialog. This could have led to malicious code\n>   execution.\n> - CVE-2024-11699: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 132, Firefox\n>   ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence\n>   of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of\n>   these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n",

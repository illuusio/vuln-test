This permitted a maliciously crafted input\n> containing very long lines to cause allocation of arbitrarily large\n> amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.\n\n> net/http, net/http/cookiejar: incorrect forwarding of sensitive\n> headers and cookies on HTTP redirect\n>\n> When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain\n> match or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not\n> forward sensitive headers such as \\\"Authorization\\\" or \\\"Cookie\\\". For\n> example, a redirect from foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the\n> Authorization header, but a redirect to bar.com will not.\n\n> html/template: errors returned from MarshalJSON methods may break\n> template escaping\n>\n> If errors returned from MarshalJSON methods contain user controlled\n> data, they may be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior\n> of the html/template package, allowing for subsequent actions to\n> inject unexpected content into templates.\n\n> net/mail: comments in display names are incorrectly handled\n>\n> The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text\n> within parentheses) within display names. Since this is a misalignment\n> with conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust\n> decisions being made by programs using different parsers.\n",

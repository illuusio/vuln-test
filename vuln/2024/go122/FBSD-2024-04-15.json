When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes,\n\t  we don't allocate memory to store the excess headers but we\n\t  do parse them. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2\n\t  endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all\n\t  associated with a request which is going to be\n\t  rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data\n\t  which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to\n\t  decode than for an attacker to send.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

    "details": "OpenPrinting reports:\n\n> Due to the service binding to \\*:631 ( INADDR_ANY ), multiple bugs in\n> cups-browsed can be exploited in sequence to introduce a malicious\n> printer to the system. This chain of exploits ultimately enables an\n> attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine\n> without authentication when a print job is started. Posing a\n> significant security risk over the network. Notably, this\n> vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited from\n> the public internet, potentially exposing a vast number of systems to\n> remote attacks if their CUPS services are enabled.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker on the internet to create a new\nprinter device with arbitrary commands in the PPD file of the printer.\nAttacks using mDNS on the local network can also replace an existing\nprinter. The commands are executed when a user attempts to print on the\nmalicious device. They run with the privileges of the user \\\"cups\\\".\n\nIt is recommended to disable the cups_browsed service until patches\nbecome available. On FreeBSD this is the default. You can check the\nstatus and disable the service with the following commands:\n\n`# service cups_browsed status`\\\n`# service cups_browsed stop`\\\n`# service cups_browsed disable`\n\nIf you choose to leave the service enabled, attacks from the internet\ncan be blocked by removing the \\\"cups\\\" protocol from the\nBrowseRemoteProtocols and BrowseProtocols directives in\n/usr/local/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf. Attacks using mDNS can be blocked\nby removing the \\\"dnssd\\\" protocol as well. Access can be limited to\nspecific IP addresses using BrowseAllow, BrowseDeny, and BrowseOrder\ndirectives as documented in cups-browsed.conf(5). Then restart the\nservice with the following command:\n\n`# service cups_browsed restart`\n",

This may be performed on the command-line\n\tby starting bhyve with the `-l tpm,passthru,/dev/tpmX` parameters.</p>\n\t<p>The MMIO handler for the emulated device did not validate the offset\n\tand size of the memory access correctly, allowing guests to read\n\tand write memory contents outside of the memory area effectively\n\tallocated.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>Malicious software running in a guest VM can exploit the buffer\n\toverflow to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace\n\tprocess, which typically runs as root.  Note that bhyve runs in a\n\tCapsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained by the capabilities\n\tavailable to the bhyve process.</p>\n      </body>\n    </description>",

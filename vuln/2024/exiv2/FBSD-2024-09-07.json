The vulnerability\n\t   is in the parser for the ASF video format, which was a new feature in v0.28.0,\n\t   so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are not affected. The out-of-bounds read is\n\t   triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

This vulnerability\n\tarises due to a lack of validation for the length field after parsing\n\tuser-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one\n\tbyte (\\0).  Under specific configurations, this can result in reading\n\tmetadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of\n\tService (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled.  ...\n\t    </li>\n\t    <li>Netatalk before 3.2.1 has an off-by-one error and resultant heap-based\n\tbuffer overflow because of setting ibuf[PASSWDLEN] to '\\0'\n\tin FPLoginExt in login in etc/uams/uams_pam.c.  2.4.1 and 3.1.19\n\tare also fixed versions.\n\t    </li>\n\t  </ul>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

Due to an\n> unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records\n> could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with\n> attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client\\'s buffer\n> size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The\n> vulnerability can only be triggered when the \\'ede: yes\\' option is\n> used; non default configuration.\n",

When a request\\'s headers\n> exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess\n> headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause\n> an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all\n> associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers\n> can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive\n> for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets\n> a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before\n> closing a connection.\n",

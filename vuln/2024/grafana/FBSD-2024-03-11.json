All other users need to be\n\t  explicitly granted permission to create a data source, which then means they\n\t  could exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p>When a user creates a data source via the\n\t  <a href=\"https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/data_source/#create-a-data-source\">API</a>,\n\t  they can specify data source UID. If the UID is set to an asterisk (*),\n\t  the user gains permissions to query, update, and delete all data sources\n\t  in the organization. The exploit, however, does not stretch across\n\t  organizations \u2014 to exploit the vulnerability in several organizations, a user\n\t  would need permissions to create data sources in each organization.</p>\n\t  <p>The vulnerability comes from a lack of UID validation. When evaluating\n\t  permissions, we interpret an asterisk (*) as a wild card for all resources.\n\t  Therefore, we should treat it as a reserved value, and not allow the creation\n\t  of a resource with the UID set to an asterisk.</p>\n\t  <p>The CVSS score for this vulnerability is\n\t  <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L&amp;version=3.1\">6 Medium</a>.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

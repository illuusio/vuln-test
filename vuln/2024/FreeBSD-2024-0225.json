The\n>     vulnerability is due to an out of bounds read. An attacker could\n>     exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to be\n>     scanned by ClamAV on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to allowing the\n>     ClamD process to write to its log file while privileged without\n>     checking if the logfile has been replaced with a symbolic link. An\n>     attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the\n>     ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then\n>     find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow\n>     the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD\n>     log messages after restart.\n",

An insufficient boundary validation\nin the USB code could lead to an out-of-bounds read on the heap, which\ncould potentially lead to an arbitrary write and remote code execution.\n\n# Impact:\n\nA malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can exploit the\nvulnerability to crash the hypervisor process or potentially achieve\ncode execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which\ntypically runs as root. Note that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so\nmalicious code is constrained by the capabilities available to the bhyve\nprocess.\n",

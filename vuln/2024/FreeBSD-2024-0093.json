This permits an attacker to cause an\n> HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all\n> associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers\n> can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive\n> for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.\n",

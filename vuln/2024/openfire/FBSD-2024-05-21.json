This permitted an unauthenticated user\n\tto use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already\n\tconfigured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the\n\tOpenfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users.  This\n\tvulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been\n\treleased since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0.  The problem\n\thas been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further\n\timprovements will be included in the yet-to-be released first version\n\ton the 4.8 branch (which is expected to be version 4.8.0).  Users\n\tare advised to upgrade.  If an Openfire upgrade isnt available for\n\ta specific release, or isnt quickly actionable, users may see the\n\tlinked github advisory (GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm) for mitigation advice.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

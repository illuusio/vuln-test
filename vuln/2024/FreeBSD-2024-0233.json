The introduced check was incorrect, as it\ntook into account the size of the pointer, not the structure. This\nvulnerability affects both kernel and userland.\n\nThis issue was originally intended to be addressed as part of\nFreeBSD-SA-24:09.libnv, but due to a logic issue, this issue was not\nproperly addressed.\n\n# Impact:\n\nIt is possible for an attacker to overwrite portions of memory (in\nuserland or the kernel) as the allocated buffer might be smaller than\nthe data received from a malicious process. This vulnerability could\nresult in privilege escalation or cause a system panic.\n",

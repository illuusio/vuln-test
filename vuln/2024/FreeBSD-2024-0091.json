Here, the\n> rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine\n> the victim\\'s private key) can derive the victim\\'s private key, and\n> then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the\n> other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to\n> conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also\n> affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3,\n> TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.\n",

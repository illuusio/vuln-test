Buttons can be arbitrarily\n>   mapped to any value up to 255 but the X.Org Server was only\n>   allocating space for the device\\'s number of buttons, leading to a\n>   heap overflow if a bigger value was used.\n>\n> - CVE-2024-0229: Reattaching to different master device may lead to\n>   out-of-bounds memory access\n>\n>   If a device has both a button class and a key class and numButtons\n>   is zero, we can get an out-of-bounds write due to event\n>   under-allocation in the DeliverStateNotifyEvent function.\n>\n> - CVE-2024-21885: Heap buffer overflow in XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent\n>\n>   The XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent() function allocates space to store\n>   up to MAXDEVICES (256) xXIHierarchyInfo structures in info. If a\n>   device with a given ID was removed and a new device with the same ID\n>   added both in the same operation, the single device ID will lead to\n>   two info structures being written to info. Since this case can occur\n>   for every device ID at once, a total of two times MAXDEVICES info\n>   structures might be written to the allocation, leading to a heap\n>   buffer overflow.\n>\n> - CVE-2024-21886: Heap buffer overflow in DisableDevice\n>\n>   The DisableDevice() function is called whenever an enabled device is\n>   disabled and it moves the device from the inputInfo.devices linked\n>   list to the inputInfo.off_devices linked list. However, its\n>   link/unlink operation has an issue during the recursive call to\n>   DisableDevice() due to the prev pointer pointing to a removed\n>   device. This issue leads to a length mismatch between the total\n>   number of devices and the number of device in the list, leading to a\n>   heap overflow and, possibly, to local privilege escalation.\n",

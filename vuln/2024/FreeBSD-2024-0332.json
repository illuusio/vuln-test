In affected versions sessions are still usable even\n> though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom\n> session handler (\\`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php\\`), to store\n> the session data in a database. Therefore, when a \\`session_id\\` is\n> given, kanboard queries the data from the \\`sessions\\` sql table. At\n> this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given \\`session_id\\`\n> has already exceeded its lifetime (\\`expires_at\\`). Thus, a session\n> which\\'s lifetime is already \\`\\> time()\\`, is still queried from the\n> database and hence a valid login. The implemented\n> \\*\\*SessionHandlerInterface::gc\\*\\* function, that does remove invalid\n> sessions, is called only \\*\\*with a certain probability\\*\\* (\\_Cleans\n> up expired sessions. Called by \\`session_start()\\`, based on\n> \\`session.gc_divisor\\`, \\`session.gc_probability\\` and\n> \\`session.gc_maxlifetime\\` settings\\_) accordingly to the php\n> documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values\n> default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus,\n> an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. There\n> are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",

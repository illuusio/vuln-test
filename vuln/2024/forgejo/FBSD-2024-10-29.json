The\n       verification of this token was not done in constant time and was\n       susceptible to timing attacks.  A pre-condition for such an attack is\n       the precise measurements of the time for each operation.  Since it\n       requires observing the timing of network operations, the issue is\n       mitigated when a Forgejo instance is accessed over the internet\n       because the ISP introduce unpredictable random delays.</li>\n       <li>Because of a missing permission check, the branch used to propose\n       a pull request to a repository can always be deleted by the user\n       performing the merge.  It was fixed so that such a deletion is only\n       allowed if the user performing the merge has write permission to the\n       repository from which the pull request was made.</li>\n       </ul>\n      </body>\n    </description>",

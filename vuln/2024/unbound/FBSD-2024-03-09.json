Due to an\n\t    unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records\n\t    could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with\n\t    attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer\n\t    size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records.\n\n\t    The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option\n\t    is used; non default configuration.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

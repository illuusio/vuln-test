(CVE-2024-51562)\n\nThe virtio_vq_recordon function is subject to a time-of-check to\ntime-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. (CVE-2024-51563)\n\nA guest can trigger an infinite loop in the hda audio driver.\n(CVE-2024-51564)\n\nThe hda driver is vulnerable to a buffer over-read from a\nguest-controlled value. (CVE-2024-51565)\n\nThe NVMe driver queue processing is vulernable to guest-induced infinite\nloops. (CVE-2024-51566)\n\n# Impact:\n\nMalicious guest virtual machines may be able to perform a denial of\nservice (DoS) of the bhyve host, and may read memory within the bhyve\nprocess that they should not be able to access.\n",

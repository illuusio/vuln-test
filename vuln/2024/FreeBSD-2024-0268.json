    "details": "# Problem Description:\n\n- Forgejo generates a token which is used to authenticate web endpoints\n  that are only meant to be used internally, for instance when the SSH\n  daemon is used to push a commit with Git. The verification of this\n  token was not done in constant time and was susceptible to timing\n  attacks. A pre-condition for such an attack is the precise\n  measurements of the time for each operation. Since it requires\n  observing the timing of network operations, the issue is mitigated\n  when a Forgejo instance is accessed over the internet because the ISP\n  introduce unpredictable random delays.\n- Because of a missing permission check, the branch used to propose a\n  pull request to a repository can always be deleted by the user\n  performing the merge. It was fixed so that such a deletion is only\n  allowed if the user performing the merge has write permission to the\n  repository from which the pull request was made.\n",

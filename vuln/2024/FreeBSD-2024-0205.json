On a site protected\n>   by Content Security Policy in \\\"strict-dynamic\\\" mode, an attacker\n>   able to inject an HTML element could have used a DOM Clobbering\n>   attack on some of the shims and achieved XSS, bypassing the CSP\n>   strict-dynamic protection.\n> - Form validation popups could capture escape key presses. Therefore,\n>   spamming form validation messages could be used to prevent users\n>   from exiting full-screen mode.\n> - When almost out-of-memory an elliptic curve key which was never\n>   allocated could have been freed again.\n> - It was possible to move the cursor using pointerlock from an iframe.\n>   This allowed moving the cursor outside of the viewport and the\n>   Firefox window.\n",

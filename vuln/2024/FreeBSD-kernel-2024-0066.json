    "details": "Problem Description:\n====================\n\n* Forgejo generates a token which is used to authenticate web\n  endpoints that are only meant to be used internally, for instance\n  when the SSH daemon is used to push a commit with Git. The\n  verification of this token was not done in constant time and was\n  susceptible to timing attacks. A pre-condition for such an attack is\n  the precise measurements of the time for each operation. Since it\n  requires observing the timing of network operations, the issue is\n  mitigated when a Forgejo instance is accessed over the internet\n  because the ISP introduce unpredictable random delays.\n* Because of a missing permission check, the branch used to propose\n  a pull request to a repository can always be deleted by the user\n  performing the merge. It was fixed so that such a deletion is only\n  allowed if the user performing the merge has write permission to the\n  repository from which the pull request was made.",

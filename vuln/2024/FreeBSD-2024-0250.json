This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial\n> of service in well orchestrated attacks.\n>\n> Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name\n> compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that\n> need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or\n> truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the\n> CPU for long.\n>\n> This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.\n",

Due to an\n> unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records\n> could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with\n> attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer\n> size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records.\n> The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option\n> is used; non default configuration.",

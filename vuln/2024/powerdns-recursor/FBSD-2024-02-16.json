The RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must\n\t  perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain\n\tsituations.</p>\n      <p>CVE-2023-50387: Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035,\n      6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial\n      of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka\n      the \"KeyTrap\" issue.  One of the concerns is that, when\n      there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol\n      specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations\n\tof DNSKEY and RRSIG records.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t</body>\n    </description>",

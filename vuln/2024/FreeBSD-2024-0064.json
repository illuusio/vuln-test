All other users\n> need to be explicitly granted permission to create a data source,\n> which then means they could exploit this vulnerability.\n>\n> When a user creates a data source via the\n> [API](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/data_source/#create-a-data-source),\n> they can specify data source UID. If the UID is set to an asterisk\n> (\\*), the user gains permissions to query, update, and delete all data\n> sources in the organization. The exploit, however, does not stretch\n> across organizations --- to exploit the vulnerability in several\n> organizations, a user would need permissions to create data sources in\n> each organization.\n>\n> The vulnerability comes from a lack of UID validation. When evaluating\n> permissions, we interpret an asterisk (\\*) as a wild card for all\n> resources. Therefore, we should treat it as a reserved value, and not\n> allow the creation of a resource with the UID set to an asterisk.\n>\n> The CVSS score for this vulnerability is [6\n> Medium](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L&version=3.1).\n",

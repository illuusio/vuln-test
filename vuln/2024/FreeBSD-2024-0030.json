This vulnerability\n>     is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values during\n>     scanning, which may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker\n>     could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file\n>     containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected\n>     device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the\n>     ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition\n>     on the affected software and consuming available system resources.\n>\n> CVE-2024-20328\n> :   Fixed a possible command injection vulnerability in the\n>     \\\"VirusEvent\\\" feature of ClamAV\\'s ClamD service. To fix this\n>     issue, we disabled the \\'%f\\' format string parameter. ClamD\n>     administrators may continue to use the\n>     \\`CLAM_VIRUSEVENT_FILENAME\\` environment variable, instead of\n>     \\'%f\\'. But you should do so only from within an executable, such\n>     as a Python script, and not directly in the clamd.conf\n>     \\\"VirusEvent\\\" command.\n",

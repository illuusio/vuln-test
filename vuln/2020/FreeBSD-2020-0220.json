When that operation is completed,\n> libcurl remembers which connection it used for that transfer and\n> \\\"easy handle\\\". It remembers the connection using a pointer to the\n> internal connectdata struct in memory.\n>\n> If more transfers are then done with the same multi handle before the\n> connect-only connection is used, leading to the initial connect-only\n> connection to get closed (for example due to idle time-out) while also\n> new transfers (and connections) are setup, such a new connection might\n> end up getting the exact same memory address as the now closed\n> connect-only connection.\n>\n> If after those operations, the application then wants to use the\n> original transfer\\'s connect-only setup to for example use\n> curl_easy_send() to send raw data over that connection, libcurl could\n> erroneously find an existing connection still being alive at the\n> address it remembered since before even though this is now a new and\n> different connection.\n>\n> The application could then accidentally send data over that connection\n> which wasn\\'t at all intended for that recipient, entirely\n> unknowingly.\n",

The previous fix for this CVE in version 0.102.3 was\n>     incomplete. This fix correctly resolves the issue.\n>\n> CVE-2020-3481\n> :   Fixed a vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV 0.102.0\n>     - 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n>     Improper error handling could cause a crash due to a NULL pointer\n>     dereference.

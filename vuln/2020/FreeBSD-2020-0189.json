Allowing\n> HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django;\n> however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to\n> insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to\n> carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege\n> escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made\n> available to editor-level users.\n>\n> The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor\n> without access to the Wagtail admin.\n",

For each key press,\n> an asterisk is printed. This option was added in response to\n> user confusion over how the standard Password: prompt disables\n> the echoing of key presses. While pwfeedback is not enabled by\n> default in the upstream version of sudo, some systems, such as\n> Linux Mint and Elementary OS, do enable it in their default\n> sudoers files.\n>\n> Due to a bug, when the pwfeedback option is enabled in the\n> sudoers file, a user may be able to trigger a stack-based buffer\n> overflow. This bug can be triggered even by users not listed in\n> the sudoers file. There is no impact unless pwfeedback has been\n> enabled.",

This issue can be mitigated by setting\n> \\`strict_hostname_checking = true\\` in \\`puppet.conf\\` on your Puppet\n> master.\n>\n> Puppet 6.13.0 changes the default behavior for\n> strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is recommended that\n> Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading\n> still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior.\n",

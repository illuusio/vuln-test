These hyperlinks can be triggered unconditionally. In fixed versions no internal protocol may be called from the document event handler and other hyperlinks require a control-click.\n>\n> Severity: Low\n> -------------\n>\n> There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.  \n> A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.\n>\n> Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue.\n>\n> Acknowledgments\n> ---------------\n>\n> The Apache OpenOffice Security Team would like to thank Imre Rad for discovering and reporting this attack vector.",

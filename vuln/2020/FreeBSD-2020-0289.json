These hyperlinks can be\n> triggered unconditionally. In fixed versions no internal protocol may\n> be called from the document event handler and other hyperlinks require\n> a control-click.\n>\n> ## Severity: Low\n>\n> There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.\\\n> A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.\n>\n> Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue.\n>\n> ## Acknowledgments\n>\n> The Apache OpenOffice Security Team would like to thank Imre Rad for\n> discovering and reporting this attack vector.\n",

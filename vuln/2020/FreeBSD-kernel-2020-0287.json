The buffer\n>   read overflow could occur when the Kerberos message\n>   indicates it contains an IPv6 address, but does not send\n>   enough data to parse out a full IPv6 address. A memory\n>   leak could occur when processing KRB\\_KDC\\_REQ KRB\\_KDC\\_REP\n>   messages for message types that do not match a known/expected\n>   type.\n> * Potential Denial of Service when sending many zero-length\n>   SSL/TLS certificate data. Such messages underwent the\n>   full Zeek file analysis treatment which is expensive (and\n>   meaninguless here) compared to how cheaply one can \"create\"\n>   or otherwise indicate many zero-length contained in an\n>   SSL message.\n> * Potential Denial of Service due to buffer read overflow\n>   in SMB transaction data string handling. The length of\n>   strings being parsed from SMB messages was trusted to be\n>   whatever the message claimed instead of the actual length\n>   of data found in the message.\n> * Potential Denial of Service due to null pointer dereference\n>   in FTP ADAT Base64 decoding.\n> * Potential Denial of Service due buffer read overflow in\n>   FTP analyzer word/whitespace handling. This typically\n>   won't be a problem in most default deployments of Zeek\n>   since the FTP analyzer receives data from a ContentLine\n>   (NVT) support analyzer which first null-terminates the\n>   buffer used for further FTP parsing.",

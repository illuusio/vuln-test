There are no known vulnerabilities addressed, but lax HTTP parsing has historically been a source of problems. Some commonly used sites are known to generate invalid HTTP headers, a --insecure-http-parser CLI option or insecureHTTPParser http option can be used if necessary for interoperability, but is not recommended.",

Allowing HTML within help\n> text is an intentional design decision by Django; however, as a matter\n> of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by\n> default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site\n> scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality\n> should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users.\n>\n> The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor\n> without access to the Wagtail admin.",

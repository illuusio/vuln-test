The vulnerability is basically a\n> cross-site request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting\n> vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus, it'\n> actually a same-site request forgery (SSRF).\n>\n> Malicious payload such as HTML containing JavaScript might be provided\n> by either an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated user\n> using a 3rd party extension - e.g. file upload in a contact form with\n> knowing the target location.\n>\n> The attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install\n> tool user session at the time of the attack to be successful.\n",

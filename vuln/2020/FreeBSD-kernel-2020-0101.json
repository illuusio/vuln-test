The code to compute the length failed to handle\ncertain malformed input, resulting in a heap overflow when the uncompressed\nlist is copied into in inadequately sized buffer.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nThe heap overflow could in principle be exploited to achieve remote code\nexecution. The affected process runs with reduced privileges in a Capsicum\nsandbox, limiting the immediate impact of an exploit. However, it is\npossible the bug could be combined with other vulnerabilities to escape the\nsandbox.",

Risk: Remote attacker\n> can keep submission-login service down, causing denial of service\n> attack. For lmtp the risk is neglible, as lmtp is usually behind a\n> trusted MTA. Steps to reproduce: Send \\`\\`NOOP EE\\\"FY\\`\\` to\n> submission port, or similarly malformed command.\n>\n> Vulnerability Details: Sending command followed by sufficient number\n> of newlines triggers a use-after-free bug that might crash\n> submission-login, submission or lmtp service. Risk: Remote attacker\n> can keep submission-login service down, causing denial of service\n> attack. For lmtp the risk is neglible, as lmtp is usually behind a\n> trusted MTA. Steps to reproduce: This can be currently reproduced with\n> ASAN or Valgrind. Reliable way to crash has not yet been discovered.\n>\n> Vulnerability Details: Sending mail with empty quoted localpart causes\n> submission or lmtp component to crash. Risk: Malicious actor can cause\n> denial of service to mail delivery by repeatedly sending mails with\n> bad sender or recipient address. Steps to reproduce: Send mail with\n> envelope sender or recipient as \\<\\\"\\\"@example.org\\>. Workaround: For\n> submission there is no workaround, but triggering the bug requires\n> valid credentials. For lmtp, one can implement sufficient filtering on\n> MTA level to prevent mails with such addresses from ending up in LMTP\n> delivery.\n",

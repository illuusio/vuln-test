When a node's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting `strict\\_hostname\\_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master.\n>\n> Puppet 6.13.0 changes the default behavior for strict\\_hostname\\_checking from false to true. It is recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading still set strict\\_hostname\\_checking to true to ensure secure behavior.",

The buffer read overflow could\n>   occur when the Kerberos message indicates it contains an IPv6\n>   address, but does not send enough data to parse out a full IPv6\n>   address. A memory leak could occur when processing KRB_KDC_REQ\n>   KRB_KDC_REP messages for message types that do not match a\n>   known/expected type.\n> - Potential Denial of Service when sending many zero-length SSL/TLS\n>   certificate data. Such messages underwent the full Zeek file\n>   analysis treatment which is expensive (and meaninguless here)\n>   compared to how cheaply one can \\\"create\\\" or otherwise indicate\n>   many zero-length contained in an SSL message.\n> - Potential Denial of Service due to buffer read overflow in SMB\n>   transaction data string handling. The length of strings being parsed\n>   from SMB messages was trusted to be whatever the message claimed\n>   instead of the actual length of data found in the message.\n> - Potential Denial of Service due to null pointer dereference in FTP\n>   ADAT Base64 decoding.\n> - Potential Denial of Service due buffer read overflow in FTP analyzer\n>   word/whitespace handling. This typically won\\'t be a problem in most\n>   default deployments of Zeek since the FTP analyzer receives data\n>   from a ContentLine (NVT) support analyzer which first\n>   null-terminates the buffer used for further FTP parsing.\n",

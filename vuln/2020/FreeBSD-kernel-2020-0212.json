The attack uses a crafted\n> reply by an authoritative name server to amplify the resulting traffic between the recursive and\n> other authoritative name servers. Both types of service can suffer degraded performance as an effect.\n>\n> CVE-2020-12244: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 through 4.3.0 where records in\n> the answer section of a NXDOMAIN response lacking an SOA were not properly validated in\n> SyncRes::processAnswer. This would allow an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to send a\n> NXDOMAIN answer for a name that does exist, bypassing DNSSEC validation.\n>\n> CVE-2020-10030: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing an attacker\n> with enough privileges to change the system's hostname to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory\n> content via a stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems where gethostname() does\n> not null-terminate the returned string if the hostname is larger than the supplied buffer. Linux\n> systems are not affected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD systems are not affected\n> because the returned hostname is always null-terminated. Under some conditions this issue can lead\n> to the writing of one null-byte out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial of service or possibly\n> arbitrary code execution.",

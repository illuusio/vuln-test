An\n> off-path attacker who can query time from the victim\\'s ntp which\n> receives time from an unauthenticated time source must be able to send\n> from a spoofed IPv4 address of upstream ntp server and and the victim\n> must be able to process a large number of packets with the spoofed\n> IPv4 address of the upstream server.

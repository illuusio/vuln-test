The attack uses a crafted reply by an\n> authoritative name server to amplify the resulting traffic between the\n> recursive and other authoritative name servers. Both types of service\n> can suffer degraded performance as an effect.\n>\n> CVE-2020-12244: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0\n> through 4.3.0 where records in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN\n> response lacking an SOA were not properly validated in\n> SyncRes::processAnswer. This would allow an attacker in position of\n> man-in-the-middle to send a NXDOMAIN answer for a name that does\n> exist, bypassing DNSSEC validation.\n>\n> CVE-2020-10030: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative\n> Server allowing an attacker with enough privileges to change the\n> system\\'s hostname to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory content\n> via a stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems where\n> gethostname() does not null-terminate the returned string if the\n> hostname is larger than the supplied buffer. Linux systems are not\n> affected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD systems\n> are not affected because the returned hostname is always\n> null-terminated. Under some conditions this issue can lead to the\n> writing of one null-byte out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial\n> of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.\n",

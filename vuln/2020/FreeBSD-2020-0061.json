Note that the issue was exploitable to\n> cause a Denial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable\n> Symbol objects, but this kind of attack is no longer valid because\n> Symbol objects are now garbage-collectable. However, creating\n> arbitrary bjects may cause severe security consequences depending upon\n> the application code.\n>\n> Please update the json gem to version 2.3.0 or later. You can use gem\n> update json to update it. If you are using bundler, please add gem\n> \\\"json\\\", \\\"\\>= 2.3.0\\\" to your Gemfile.\n",

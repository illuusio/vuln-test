[CVE-2017-3737]\n\nThere is an overflow bug in the x86\\_64 Montgomery\nmultiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit\nmoduli. This only affects processors that support the AVX2\nbut not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation).\n[CVE-2017-3738] This bug only affects FreeBSD 11.x.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nApplications with incorrect error handling may inappropriately\npass unencrypted data. [CVE-2017-3737]\n\nMishandling of carry propagation will produce incorrect\noutput, and make it easier for a remote attacker to obtain\nsensitive private-key information. No EC algorithms are\naffected and analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and\nDSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to\nperform and are not believed likely.\n\nAttacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible\n(although very difficult) because most of the work necessary\nto deduce information about a private key may be performed\noffline. The amount of resources required for such an attack\nwould be very significant and likely only accessible to a\nlimited number of attackers. However, for an attack on TLS\nto be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024\nprivate key among multiple clients, which is no longer an\noption since CVE-2016-0701. [CVE-2017-3738]",

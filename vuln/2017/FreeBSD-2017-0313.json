For example, \\'Buffer.alloc(0x100, \\\"This is not\n> correctly encoded\\\", \\\"hex\\\");\\' The buffer implementation was updated\n> such that the buffer will be initialized to all zeros in these cases.\n>\n> # Also included in OpenSSL update - CVE 2017-3738\n>\n> Note that CVE 2017-3738 of OpenSSL-1.0.2 affected Node but it was low\n> severity.\n",

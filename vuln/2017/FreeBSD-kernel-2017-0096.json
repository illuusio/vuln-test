The server then responds with a 257 response containing\n> the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by\n> libcurl for subsequent uses.\n>\n> Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory\n> name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to\n> libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name.\n> When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond\n> the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the\n> buffer, thinking it was part of the path.\n>\n> A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent\n> libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued\n> on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a\n> segfault.",

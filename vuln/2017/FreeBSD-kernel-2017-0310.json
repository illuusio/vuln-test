An attacker can request\nloading of a PKCS#11 module across forwarded agent-socket.\n[CVE-2016-10009]\n\nWhen privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix\ndomain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges\nof 'root' instead of the authenticated user. [CVE-2016-10010]\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nA remote attacker who have control of a forwarded\nagent-socket on a remote system and have the ability to\nwrite files on the system running ssh-agent(1) agent can\nrun arbitrary code under the same user credential. Because\nthe attacker must already have some control on both systems,\nit is relatively hard to exploit this vulnerability in a\npractical attack. [CVE-2016-10009]\n\nWhen privilege separation is disabled (on FreeBSD,\nprivilege separation is enabled by default and has to be\nexplicitly disabled), an authenticated attacker can potentially\ngain root privileges on systems running OpenSSH server.\n[CVE-2016-10010]",

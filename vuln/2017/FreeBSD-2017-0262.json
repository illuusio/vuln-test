Usernames were not being properly HTML escaped\n> inside the author filter would could allow arbitrary script execution.\n>\n> # Open redirect in repository git redirects\n>\n> Eric Rafaloff via HackerOne reported that GitLab was vulnerable to an\n> open redirect vulnerability when redirecting requests for repository\n> names that include the git extension. GitLab was not properly removing\n> dangerous parameters from the params field before redirecting which\n> could allow an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary hosts.\n>\n> # Username changes could leave repositories behind\n>\n> An internal code review discovered that a bug in the code that moves\n> repositories during a username change could potentially leave behind\n> projects, allowing an attacker who knows the previous username to\n> potentially steal the contents of repositories on instances that are\n> not configured with hashed namespaces.\n",

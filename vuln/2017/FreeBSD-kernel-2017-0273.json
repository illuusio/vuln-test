If the server doesn't support\n> the extension, or fails to provide said proof, curl is expected to\n> return an error.  \n> Due to a coding mistake, the code that checks for a test success or\n> failure, ends up always thinking there's valid proof, even when\n> there is none or if the server doesn't support the TLS extension in\n> question. Contrary to how it used to function and contrary to how\n> this feature is documented to work.  \n> This could lead to users not detecting when a server's certificate\n> goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better\n> shape than it is in reality.",

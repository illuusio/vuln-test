The built-in wildcard function has\n>   a flaw that makes it not detect the end of the pattern string if it\n>   ends with an open bracket (\\[) but instead it will continue reading\n>   the heap beyond the end of the URL buffer that holds the wildcard.\n> - SSL out of buffer access (CVE-2017-8818)\\\n>   libcurl contains an out boundary access flaw in SSL related code.\n>   When allocating memory for a connection (the internal struct called\n>   connectdata), a certain amount of memory is allocated at the end of\n>   the struct to be used for SSL related structs. Those structs are\n>   used by the particular SSL library libcurl is built to use.

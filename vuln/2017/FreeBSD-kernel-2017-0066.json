The sanitization\n> filter was not properly stripping invalid characters from URL schemes and\n> was therefore vulnerable to persistent XSS attacks anywhere Markdown was\n> supported.\n>\n> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search bar\n> ======================================================\n>\n> Josh Unger reported a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the\n> issue search bar. Usernames were not being properly HTML escaped inside the\n> author filter would could allow arbitrary script execution.\n>\n> Open redirect in repository git redirects\n> =========================================\n>\n> Eric Rafaloff via HackerOne reported that GitLab was vulnerable to an\n> open redirect vulnerability when redirecting requests for repository names\n> that include the git extension. GitLab was not properly removing dangerous\n> parameters from the params field before redirecting which could allow an\n> attacker to redirect users to arbitrary hosts.\n>\n> Username changes could leave repositories behind\n> ================================================\n>\n> An internal code review discovered that a bug in the code that moves\n> repositories during a username change could potentially leave behind\n> projects, allowing an attacker who knows the previous username to\n> potentially steal the contents of repositories on instances that are not\n> configured with hashed namespaces.",

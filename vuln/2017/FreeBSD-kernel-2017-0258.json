Tatham reports:\n\n> Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.68 have a heap-corrupting integer\n> overflow bug in the ssh\\_agent\\_channel\\_data function which processes\n> messages sent by remote SSH clients to a forwarded agent connection. [...]\n>\n> This bug is only exploitable at all if you have enabled SSH\n> agent forwarding, which is turned off by default. Moreover, an\n> attacker able to exploit this bug would have to have already be able\n> to connect to the Unix-domain socket representing the forwarded\n> agent connection. Since any attacker with that capability would\n> necessarily already be able to generate signatures with your agent's\n> stored private keys, you should in normal circumstances be defended\n> against this vulnerability by the same precautions you and your\n> operating system were already taking to prevent untrusted people\n> from accessing your SSH agent.",

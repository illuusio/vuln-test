Instead of only learning a new address when\n> expected the new code allowed a new source address to be\n> learned at all times.\n>\n> AST-2017-006 - The app\\_minivm module has an \"externnotify\"\n> program configuration option that is executed by the\n> MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses\n> the caller-id name and number as part of a built string\n> passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution.\n> Since the caller-id name and number can come from an\n> untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number\n> allows an arbitrary shell command injection.",

Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will\n> lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n>\n> The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment as\n> unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n> XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the\n> check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following\n> addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate\n> less memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n",

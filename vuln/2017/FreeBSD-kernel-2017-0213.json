By overrunning\n> the buffer, the memory allocation table becomes corrupted,\n> leading to an eventual crash.\n>\n> The multi-part body parser in PJSIP contains a logical\n> error that can make certain multi-part body parts attempt\n> to read memory from outside the allowed boundaries. A\n> specially-crafted packet can trigger these invalid reads\n> and potentially induce a crash.\n>\n> This issues is in PJSIP, and so the issue can be fixed\n> without performing an upgrade of Asterisk at all. However,\n> we are releasing a new version of Asterisk with the bundled\n> PJProject updated to include the fix.\n>\n> If you are running Asterisk with chan\\_sip, this issue\n> does not affect you.",

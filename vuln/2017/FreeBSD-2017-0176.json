The command line git client\n> was not properly escaping command line arguments in URLs using the SSH\n> protocol before invoking the SSH client. A specially crafted URL could\n> be used to execute arbitrary shell commands on the GitLab server.\\\n> To fully patch this vulnerability two fixes were needed. The Omnibus\n> versions of GitLab contain a patched git client. For source users who\n> may still be running an older version of git, GitLab now also blocks\n> import URLs containing invalid host and usernames.\\\n> This issue has been assigned CVE-2017-12426.\n>\n> # Improper sanitization of GitLab export files on import\n>\n> GitLab versions 8.13.3, 8.12.8, 8.11.10, 8.10.13, and 8.9.12 contained\n> a patch for a critical directory traversal vulnerability in the GitLab\n> export feature that could be exploited by including symlinks in the\n> export file and then re-importing it to a GitLab instance. This\n> vulnerability was patched by checking for and removing symlinks in\n> these files on import.\\\n> Recurity-Labs also determined that this fix did not properly remove\n> symlinks for hidden files. Though not as dangerous as the original\n> vulnerability hidden file symlinks could still be used to steal copies\n> of git repositories belonging to other users if the path to the git\n> repository was known by the attacker. An updated fix has been included\n> in these releases that properly removes all symlinks.\\\n> This import option was not made available to non-admin users until\n> GitLab 8.13.0.\n",

The variable len is assigned strlen(buf). If\nthe content-\\>type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the\ncontent-\\>prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii)\ncontent-\\>name is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether\nthe content-\\>name actually fits also uses \\'len\\' rather than the\nupdated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to write about\n\\\"size\\\" many bytes beyond the allocated memory.

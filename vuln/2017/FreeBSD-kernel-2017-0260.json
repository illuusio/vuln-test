    "details": "Janos Follath reports:\n\n> * If a malicious peer supplies a certificate with a specially\n>   crafted secp224k1 public key, then an attacker can cause the\n>   server or client to attempt to free block of memory held on\n>   stack. Depending on the platform, this could result in a Denial\n>   of Service (client crash) or potentially could be exploited to\n>   allow remote code execution with the same privileges as the host\n>   application.\n> * If the client and the server both support MD5 and the client\n>   can be tricked to authenticate to a malicious server, then the\n>   malicious server can impersonate the client. To launch this man\n>   in the middle attack, the adversary has to compute a\n>   chosen-prefix MD5 collision in real time. This is very expensive\n>   computationally, but can be practical. Depending on the\n>   platform, this could result in a Denial of Service (client crash)\n>   or potentially could be exploited to allow remote code execution\n>   with the same privileges as the host application.\n> * A bug in the logic of the parsing of a PEM encoded Certificate\n>   Revocation List in mbedtls\\_x509\\_crl\\_parse() can result in an\n>   infinite loop. In versions before 1.3.10 the same bug results in\n>   an infinite recursion stack overflow that usually crashes the\n>   application. Methods and means of acquiring the CRLs is not part\n>   of the TLS handshake and in the strict TLS setting this\n>   vulnerability cannot be triggered remotely. The vulnerability\n>   cannot be triggered unless the application explicitly calls\n>   mbedtls\\_x509\\_crl\\_parse() or mbedtls\\_x509\\_crl\\_parse\\_file()on a PEM\n>   formatted CRL of untrusted origin. In which case the\n>   vulnerability can be exploited to launch a denial of service\n>   attack against the application.",

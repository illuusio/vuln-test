This can allow the\n> login of users who have no password set even if the\n> administrator has set $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']\n> to false (which is also the default).\n>\n> This behavior depends on the PHP version used (it seems\n> PHP 5 is affected, while PHP 7.0 is not).\n>\n> ### Severity\n>\n> We consider this vulnerability to be of moderate severity.\n>\n> ### Mitigation factor\n>\n> Set a password for all users.",

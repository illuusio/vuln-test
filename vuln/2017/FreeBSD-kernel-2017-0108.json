Several areas have been identified in the Documents and Emails module that could allow an authenticated user to perform SQL injection, as demonstrated by a backslash character at the end of a bean\\_id to modules/Emails/DetailView.php. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SQL request to the affected areas. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify the SQL database. Proper SQL escaping has been added to prevent such exploits.\n>\n> An issue was discovered in SugarCRM before 7.7.2.3, 7.8.x before 7.8.2.2, and 7.9.x before 7.9.2.0 (and Sugar Community Edition 6.5.26).

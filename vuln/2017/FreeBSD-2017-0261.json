Information could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g.,\n> using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into\n> saving the document and convincing the user to sent the document back\n> to the attacker.\n>\n> The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know\n> the precise file path in the target system, and the need to trick the\n> user into saving the document and sending it back.\n\n> # CVE-2017-9806: Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer\\'s WW8Fonts Constructor\n>\n> A vulnerability in the OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and\n> specifically in the WW8Fonts Constructor, allows attackers to craft\n> malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption\n> and application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code\n> execution.\n\n> # CVE-2017-12607: Out-of-Bounds Write in Impress\\' PPT Filter\n>\n> A vulnerability in OpenOffice\\'s PPT file parser, and specifically in\n> PPTStyleSheet, allows attackers to craft malicious documents that\n> cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash)\n> potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n> # CVE-2017-12608: Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer\\'s ImportOldFormatStyles\n>\n> A vulnerability in OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and specifically\n> in ImportOldFormatStyles, allows attackers to craft malicious\n> documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption and\n> application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n",

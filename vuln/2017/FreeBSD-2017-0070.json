Tatham reports:\n\n> Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.68 have a heap-corrupting integer\n> overflow bug in the ssh_agent_channel_data function which processes\n> messages sent by remote SSH clients to a forwarded agent connection.\n> \\[\\...\\]\n>\n> This bug is only exploitable at all if you have enabled SSH agent\n> forwarding, which is turned off by default. Moreover, an attacker able\n> to exploit this bug would have to have already be able to connect to\n> the Unix-domain socket representing the forwarded agent connection.\n> Since any attacker with that capability would necessarily already be\n> able to generate signatures with your agent\\'s stored private keys,\n> you should in normal circumstances be defended against this\n> vulnerability by the same precautions you and your operating system\n> were already taking to prevent untrusted people from accessing your\n> SSH agent.\n",

The command line git client was not\n> properly escaping command line arguments in URLs using the SSH protocol\n> before invoking the SSH client. A specially crafted URL could be used to\n> execute arbitrary shell commands on the GitLab server.  \n> To fully patch this vulnerability two fixes were needed. The Omnibus\n> versions of GitLab contain a patched git client. For source users who may\n> still be running an older version of git, GitLab now also blocks import URLs\n> containing invalid host and usernames.  \n> This issue has been assigned CVE-2017-12426.\n>\n> Improper sanitization of GitLab export files on import\n> ======================================================\n>\n> GitLab versions 8.13.3, 8.12.8, 8.11.10, 8.10.13, and 8.9.12 contained a\n> patch for a critical directory traversal vulnerability in the GitLab export\n> feature that could be exploited by including symlinks in the export file and\n> then re-importing it to a GitLab instance. This vulnerability was patched by\n> checking for and removing symlinks in these files on import.  \n> Recurity-Labs also determined that this fix did not properly remove symlinks for\n> hidden files. Though not as dangerous as the original vulnerability hidden file\n> symlinks could still be used to steal copies of git repositories belonging to\n> other users if the path to the git repository was known by the attacker. An\n> updated fix has been included in these releases that properly removes all\n> symlinks.  \n> This import option was not made available to non-admin users until GitLab\n> 8.13.0.",

If the server doesn\\'t support the\n> extension, or fails to provide said proof, curl is expected to return\n> an error.\\\n> Due to a coding mistake, the code that checks for a test success or\n> failure, ends up always thinking there\\'s valid proof, even when there\n> is none or if the server doesn\\'t support the TLS extension in\n> question. Contrary to how it used to function and contrary to how this\n> feature is documented to work.\\\n> This could lead to users not detecting when a server\\'s certificate\n> goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better\n> shape than it is in reality.\n",

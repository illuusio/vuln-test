This was a result of building with V8 snapshots enabled by\n> default which caused the initially randomized seed to be overwritten\n> on startup. Thanks to Jann Horn of Google Project Zero for reporting\n> this vulnerability.\n>\n> This is a high severity vulnerability and applies to all active\n> release lines (4.x, 6.x, 8.x) as well as the 7.x line.\n>\n> http.get with numeric authorization options creates uninitialized\n> buffers\n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>\n> Application code that allows the auth field of the options object\n> used with http.get() to be set to a number can result in an\n> uninitialized buffer being created/used as the authentication\n> string.\n>\n> This is a low severity defect and only applies to the 4.x release\n> line.",

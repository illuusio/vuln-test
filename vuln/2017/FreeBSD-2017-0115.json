The issue is that the PJSIP RFC 2543 transaction key\n> generation algorithm does not allocate a large enough buffer. By\n> overrunning the buffer, the memory allocation table becomes corrupted,\n> leading to an eventual crash.\n>\n> The multi-part body parser in PJSIP contains a logical error that can\n> make certain multi-part body parts attempt to read memory from outside\n> the allowed boundaries. A specially-crafted packet can trigger these\n> invalid reads and potentially induce a crash.\n>\n> This issues is in PJSIP, and so the issue can be fixed without\n> performing an upgrade of Asterisk at all. However, we are releasing a\n> new version of Asterisk with the bundled PJProject updated to include\n> the fix.\n>\n> If you are running Asterisk with chan_sip, this issue does not affect\n> you.\n",

This only affects processors that support\nthe BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th\ngeneration) and later or AMD Ryzen. [CVE-2017-3736] This\nbug only affects FreeBSD 11.x.\n\nImpact:\n=======\n\nApplication using OpenSSL may display erroneous certificate\nin text format. [CVE-2017-3735]\n\nMishandling of carry propagation will produce incorrect\noutput, and make it easier for a remote attacker to obtain\nsensitive private-key information. No EC algorithms are\naffected, analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and\nDSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to\nperform and are not believed likely.\n\nAttacks against DH are considered just feasible (although\nvery difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce\ninformation about a private key may be performed offline.\nThe amount of resources required for such an attack would\nbe very significant and likely only accessible to a limited\nnumber of attackers. An attacker would additionally need\nonline access to an unpatched system using the target private\nkey in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private\nkey that is shared between multiple clients.

The\n> primary findings were two remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities.\n> Fixes to them have been backported to v2.3.15.\n>\n> An authenticated client can do the 'three way handshake'\n> (P\\_HARD\\_RESET, P\\_HARD\\_RESET, P\\_CONTROL), where the P\\_CONTROL packet\n> is the first that is allowed to carry payload. If that payload is\n> too big, the OpenVPN server process will stop running due to an\n> ASSERT() exception. That is also the reason why servers using\n> tls-auth/tls-crypt are protected against this attack - the P\\_CONTROL\n> packet is only accepted if it contains the session ID we specified,\n> with a valid HMAC (challenge-response). (CVE-2017-7478)\n>\n> An authenticated client can cause the server's the packet-id\n> counter to roll over, which would lead the server process to hit an\n> ASSERT() and stop running. To make the server hit the ASSERT(), the\n> client must first cause the server to send it 2^32 packets (at least\n> 196 GB).",

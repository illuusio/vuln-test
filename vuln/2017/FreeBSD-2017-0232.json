The server then responds with a 257 response\n> containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is\n> then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses.\n>\n> Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a\n> directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote\n> would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer\n> holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it\n> could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly\n> access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path.\n>\n> A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent\n> libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always\n> issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of\n> causing a segfault.\n",

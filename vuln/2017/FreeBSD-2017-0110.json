The\n> primary findings were two remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities.\n> Fixes to them have been backported to v2.3.15.\n>\n> An authenticated client can do the \\'three way handshake\\'\n> (P_HARD_RESET, P_HARD_RESET, P_CONTROL), where the P_CONTROL packet is\n> the first that is allowed to carry payload. If that payload is too\n> big, the OpenVPN server process will stop running due to an ASSERT()\n> exception. That is also the reason why servers using\n> tls-auth/tls-crypt are protected against this attack - the P_CONTROL\n> packet is only accepted if it contains the session ID we specified,\n> with a valid HMAC (challenge-response). (CVE-2017-7478)\n>\n> An authenticated client can cause the server\\'s the packet-id counter\n> to roll over, which would lead the server process to hit an ASSERT()\n> and stop running. To make the server hit the ASSERT(), the client must\n> first cause the server to send it 2\\^32 packets (at least 196 GB).\n",

This vulnerability could\n> allow a user with access to assign ownership of an issue or merge request to\n> another user to disclose that user's private token, email token, email\n> address, and encrypted OTP secret. Reporter-level access to a GitLab project\n> is required to exploit this flaw.\n>\n> SSRF when importing a project from a Repo by URL\n> ================================================\n>\n> GitLab instances that have enabled project imports using \"Repo by URL\"\n> were vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery attacks. By specifying a\n> project import URL of localhost an attacker could target services that are\n> bound to the local interface of the server. These services often do not\n> require authentication. Depending on the service an attacker might be able\n> craft an attack using the project import request URL.\n>\n> Links in Environments tab vulnerable to tabnabbing\n> ==================================================\n>\n> edio via HackerOne reported that user-configured Environment links\n> include target=\\_blank but do not also include rel: noopener\n> noreferrer. Anyone clicking on these links may therefore be subjected to\n> tabnabbing attacks where a link back to the requesting page is maintained\n> and can be manipulated by the target server.\n>\n> Accounts with email set to \"Do not show on profile\" have addresses\n> exposed in public atom feed\n> ==============================================================================================\n>\n> Several GitLab users reported that even with \"Do not show on profile\"\n> configured for their email addresses those addresses were still being leaked\n> in Atom feeds if they commented on a public project.",

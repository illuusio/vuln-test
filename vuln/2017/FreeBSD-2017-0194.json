When\n> combined with the symmetric RTP support this introduced an avenue\n> where media could be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address\n> when expected the new code allowed a new source address to be learned\n> at all times.\n>\n> AST-2017-006 - The app_minivm module has an \\\"externnotify\\\" program\n> configuration option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan\n> application. The application uses the caller-id name and number as\n> part of a built string passed to the OS shell for interpretation and\n> execution. Since the caller-id name and number can come from an\n> untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an\n> arbitrary shell command injection.\n",

Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in\n> turn will lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent\n> reads.\n>\n> The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment\n> as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n> XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows\n> the check against XCURSOR\\_COMMENT\\_MAX\\_LEN to pass, and the following\n> addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to\n> allocate less memory than needed for subsequent reads.",
